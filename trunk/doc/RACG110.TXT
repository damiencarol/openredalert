CHAPTER [1]  Introduction
-------------------------

[1-1]  Foreword and Introduction
================================
    This document represents a significant investment of time by the two
  authors, the purpose of which is to see the creation of new single player
  missions for the game Red Alert.  Just as there were hundreds of single
  player missions created for the original Command and Conquer, we hope
  that the same will be true for Red Alert.

    It is a sad fact that this guide has to be created by someone other
  than the company that created Red Alert, but for whatever reasons they
  had, Westwood Studios decided to supply a terrain editor that could
  create new multiplayer missions, but could not create new single player
  missions.  In order to create a new single player mission, you will use
  the terrain editor to create the map, but will also be using a text
  editor to do everything else.
    That being said, my co-author has this to say (which I agree with, a
  least to a limited extent):
    I don't have a quarrel with Westwood's policy here.  Their bread and
  butter is making and selling maps and scenarios.  After the host of bad
  C&C missions that were made by independents, they should naturally be
  cautious about giving the means to make RA scenarios to all and every.
  Gresham's Law applies here.  They did give us the Rules.ini file,
  and they didn't have to do that.

    There you have what are essentially the two sides to the story: if
  Westwood released their information, then the good mission makers would
  be able to create better missions.  The flipside to this is that there
  would be a lot more poor missions, making it that much harder to sift
  through the dross.

    The more discerning reader will notice that there are gaps in our
  knowledge throughout some sections in this guide.  We have made a
  significant effort to work out these sections, but there is only so much
  that two brains can accomplish in a finite amount of time.  If you work
  out what one of the missing sections pertains to, or have further
  information on something that we have already commented on, then please
  get in contact so that we can make this document as accurate as
  possible.  If you do make a submission, we ask that you test it
  thoroughly.

    Making single player missions for Red Alert is not easy, even if you
  have some previous experience with creating new missions for Command and
  Conquer.  This is mainly through the increased complexity of the
  triggers that you now have access to, which enable some quite
  intricate activities.  Yes, you can create a mission using just the
  simplistic forms of triggers, but it is the opinion of this author that
  this is akin to buying a car to drive up and down the driveway. 
  However, we do recommend that you start off by learning the basics.
  Start with a blank map and just experiment until you begin to get the
  feel of the way the Red Alert triggers operate.

    We wish you the very best in your efforts.

    And, yes, we know the title is a bit of a mouthful, but what else
  could this be called?  And I also know that my typing style tends to the
  verbose, but in this case I do not see that as a problem.  An effort has
  been made to keep all lines to 74 characters or less, but in the case
  where I have included sections from an external file, this may not be
  possible. 


[1-2]  What this guide is NOT
=============================
    This guide is not meant to tell you what makes a good mission; that
  changes from person to person.  If I start to preach about what I
  feel makes a good mission, I trust you to forgive my lapse.

    This guide is also not meant to make everyone into a mission making
  guru.  If you were good at creating single player missions for Command
  and Conquer, then you are already a step ahead, as many of the actions
  you must perform are the same.  If you have never made a mission before
  all I can say is: give it a try, you may be great at it.

    This guide will also not tell you that I think story is the most
  important part of any mission.  Again, the two authors differ in what we
  see making a good mission.  To quote cfh: "I'm just a nuts-n-bolts
  kill-em-all type. Plot be damned."

    This guide will not become a 'how do I edit the rules.ini file?'
  guide.  It will address single player mission creation only.

    This guide is not meant to encourage you to email us.  My email policy
  is based on mass recycling (which means that I delete those emails that
  I have no intention of replying to).  Do not contact the authors if you
  want to ask how to do something with a trigger or teamtype, for you are
  likely to end up on the trash heap.

    Just one final note: do NOT send Andrew any of your faulty missions. 
  He is a grumpy fellow, and will not debug them for you.


[1-3]  Getting the guide
========================
    This guide will NOT be sent out by the authors via email, so don't
  even bother to ask.

[1-3-1]  Usenet
---------------
    A pointer to the Red Alert Single Player Mission Creation Guide will
  be posted irregularly on the following newsgroups:
      (1) alt.games.command-n-conq
      (2) comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.strategic
    Just how often this is posted depends mainly upon when new versions
  are created, and also how lazy I feel.  (I do not get the Red Alert
  newsgroups on my news server, so can only post to them if I use
  dejanews).

    Many thanks to Roger Wong for allowing me to copy the style of his Red
  Alert Internet Strategy Guide.
    Much gratitude to Osprey for providing some superb explanations for
  part 2 of the [TeamTypes] entry, along with a lot of other information,
  including the new fences1.mpr file.

[1-6]  Accuracy of Information
==============================
    We have made a significant effort to make sure that the information
  contained within this guide is as accurate as possible.  However, this
  is not always possible when it comes to sections such as the teamtypes
  section.  

    All information retrieval is subject to personal bias, and it may be
  the case that the testbeds that were used in the collection of this
  information introduced a bias into what we were seeing.



==============================
-SECTION ONE- GENERAL OVERVIEW
==============================

-----------------------------------
CHAPTER [2]  Notes Before You Start
-----------------------------------

[2-1]  Negative numbers - what's the deal?
==========================================
    If you look at the original Red Alert missions, you will notice
  almost immediately that the numbers used in this guide for things such
  as speech items, sound effect, etc are completely different from those
  used in the missions.  However, on closer scrutiny, you will see that
  this is, in fact, not the case.  The numbers used in the original
  missions are all negative numbers, those used in this guide are all
  positive numbers.

    To convert from the negative numbers in the original missions to the
  positive numbers used in this guide, you simply do the following:
  if the negative number is in the negative hundreds (ie -200, -100, -57
  etc), then all you have to do is add 256 to that negative number to get
  the positive number.  In the rare occasions where the negative number is
  is the negative 65,000 range, then you add 65536 to get the respective
  positive number.

    You may be wondering why we chose to use the positive numbers rather
  than the negative numbers.  There are two reasons for this.  The first
  reason is that it is simply more intuitive to use the positive numbers.
  The second reason comes from a belief that I have that the use of the
  negative numbers in the original mission files comes from a bug in the
  Westwood mission creation program.  Apparently the parser is competent
  enough to deal with this error, which is a possible reason it was never
  picked up.  Of course, it doesn't matter one way or another, as long as
  it works.

    If you really want to use negative numbers, then simply subtract 256
  from the numbers that we have given you.  The only place you don't use
  negative numbers (another reason I assume the occurance of negative
  numbers is a programming bug) is where the second part of a trigger is
  used to specify a specific country.  In these cases, the Westwood
  missions use the positive country numbers.


[2-2]  Determining where things go
==================================
    One of the first things you may notice is that you need to specify
  cell values for a wide variety of things, but there really isn't an easy
  way to get the required cell values when using the terrain editor. 
  There are a number of ways in which you can use the terrain editor to
  provide cell values, although all but one method are work-arounds. 
  However, all methods require you to load up a file after you have
  finished editing the map.  For this reason, if you are using Windows 95,
  you have a great advantage, as you can just minimise the terrain editor,
  and open the required file.  For users that only have MS-DOS installed
  on their computers, I am afraid that you will exit the terrain editor
  (and hence suffer the long load time when you want to use it again).

    The easiest way to use the terrain editor to determine the numbering
  of a specific cell on the map is to use the flags.  When you place the
  flags, you are actually creating an entry in the [Waypoints] section of
  the map file.  It is then very easy for you to get these cell values for
  use in other regions of the ini file.  However, there are unfortunately
  only a limited number of flags, meaning that if you use this method that
  you will have to repeatedly save the map file to get further cell
  values. The color sequence of the flags is the same as the waypoint 
  number sequence.

    The other method to get cell values is to use something else to
  pin-point a cell value.  This must be something that appears in a
  section like [Terrain], which means trees, or a goldmine.  You cannot
  use things that appear as an overlay (gold, gems, walls etc), as these
  are encoded into the [OverlayPack] section of the ini file.  If you
  decide to use this method of determining a cell's numbering, you should
  do it before you place the rest of the map's terrain features (i.e. finish
  the map in so far as you have all the cliffs and rivers and gold that
  you want, but don't put in any trees yet).  Use your personal preference
  as to whether you want to use a single type of tree for this job, or
  whether you want to use multiple types (personally, I find it easier to
  use a single type, with a goldmine occasionally thrown in to highlight a
  particular cell).  Then, place these trees (or etc) around the map where
  you want to place things like buildings, units, or that you just want to
  specify as waypoints.

    Once you have edited your ini file using these cell values to place
  your structures and units, you can then edit your .mpr file to get rid
  of the now superfluous terrain features. 

    This is the most tedious part of the whole process.


[2-3]  .ini and .mpr files
==========================
    When you use the supplied terrain editor to create a map, saving your
  map creates a file with an .mpr extension.  The name of the
  file will correspond to the name you gave the map when it was created,
  taking the first seven (at most) letters to create the filename.  The
  format of a .mpr file is the same as an .ini file, and you should use
  this .mpr file as the template of your mission file.  Multiplayer files
  have the extension .mpr (when you use the terrain editor, you are
  actually creating a multiplayer mission).

    The files you will be using to create single player missions must be 
  given the extension .ini.  These files (as do the .mpr files) have the same
  format as all .ini files, in that they consist of a number of different
  sections.  Each section contains a heading enclosed in square brackets
  (such as [England]), and consists of a number of entries, one to a line,
  after that heading.  A ';' (semi-colon) signifies a comment, and
  everything after a ';' is ignored.

    To create a single player mission, you must give your .ini file a
  specific name, corresponding to the mission that you wish to replace.
  See the section Red Alert Mission Tree for the internal mission numbers
  (i.e. scg01ea, scg02ea etc); you take this internal mission number as the
  first part of the filename, and give the file the extension .ini (so,
  you will get scg01ea.ini, scg02ea.ini etc).  By using the correct
  filename, you are able to replace the original missions in Red Alert
  with your new mission.


[2-4]  A warning about Red Alert's parser
=========================================
    You should be made aware that the parser Red Alert uses to read in the
  .ini files is case sensitive.  This means that if you have a section
  called [Terrain], that you will have no trees (you must use [TERRAIN]).
  Always use the exact spelling we have given in this document.  A single
  typo can crash this game horribly.  It is best to construct the scenario
  in small pieces, testing as you go.  The DOS version is much
  more tolerant of errors than the Windows 95 version.


[2-5]  Placing walls around the map
===================================
    Unfortunately, you cannot place any type of walls in the terrain
  editor, at least not without some work.  To place walls on a map, you
  first need to copy a wall piece from one map, and paste that into your
  new map.

    First, open your map file that has some walls on it.  Next, select the
  tile that you require.  You select a section of the map by left clicking
  on the map - the tile will be surrounded by a white square.  Now, click
  the right mouse button and choose Copy from the list of choices. 

    Load the map you wish to place the wall section onto, and select the
  spot into which you wish to place the wall section.  Right click and
  select Paste.  You can now place the wall tiles anywhere around the map.

    Do not worry that the graphics of the walls look strange (ie they do
  not join up as they are supposed to do), as this will go away once the
  map is loaded again.  Alternatively, you can force a section of wall to
  be redrawn (they will appear normally after the redraw) by placing a map
  tile (usually just the blank cell) next to the wall section.

[2-5-1]  Fences1.mpr file
-------------------------
    For your convenience, here is a very small .mpr file that contains 6 
  types of walls.  It contains the sandbag (SBAG), chain-link (CYCL),
  concrete (BRIK), barbed-wire (BARB), wooden (WOOD) and the 
  normal barbed- wire (FENC) wall types.  It also contains the flag 
  position ring and the crate types (even though these three things
  are available in the terrain editor).  This file has the name
  fences1.mpr.  In the Windows 95 terrain editor, it is smaller than the
  displayed area, so you cannot scroll the map.  Simply put this map into
  your Red Alert directory, and copy the required fence type.

 autocreation     Autocreation means that instead of a teamtype being 
                   manually created by a Create Team trigger action, that
                   it will be subject to the autocreate function. Each
                   computer country can have its autocreation function
                   turned on through a trigger action, after which the
                   creation of the teamtypes that have autocreation turned
                   on will be subject to being created, at the whim of the
                   autocreate function. See [TeamTypes] Section for more
                   details.
 cell             A Red Alert map is really a 128x128 square. A cell is
                   the size of one unit of this square, so the square would
                   be 128x128 cells in size. See the [Waypoints] section for
                   a more detailed explanation of the way the map is divided
                   into cells.
 country          When we mention a country, we are talking about an 
                   individual entity, much like real countries. They are
                   either controlled by the human player, or by the
                   computer. All units and buildings owned by a country
                   can only be controlled by the controller of that
                   country (human or computer).
 expires          When talking about the global timer, we say that the timer
                   has expired when the timer count has reached zero.
 fired trigger    A fired trigger is a trigger that has been activated (ie,
                   its firing conditions were met).
 forced trigger   A trigger that, on its own, cannot be fired. It can only
                   be fired by another trigger.
 global timer     Like a stop watch that works in reverse. It counts down
                   from a specified time until it expires. There is only one
                   global timer in Red Alert.
 global value     Consider this to be a switch, which has an On and Off
                   position. We say that a global value is 'set' when it is
                   in the On position, and that is it 'clear' when it is in
                   the Off position.
 house            See country.
 IQ level         How 'smart' a particular computer player is, in Red Alert
                   terms. See Discussion on IQ Levels for a more detailed 
                   description on IQ levels in computer players.
 full map        The entire 128x128 map. This differs from the map that you
                   will be using for you mission, which is a subset of the
                   full map square.
 mission map     That section of the full map that you are using for your
                  mission. It is a subsection of the full map.
 parameter        A value that is being passed to some item.
 player           Usually referring to the human player.
 team             Shorthand for a teamtype.
 teamtype         A collection of units, whether they be vehicles, infantry,
                   ships, aircraft, or a mixture. It can also refer to a
                   line in the [TeamTypes] section.
 time unit        The smallest amount of time in Red Alert. This changes
                   depending on the speed at which you have Red Alert
                   running, but is 6 seconds of Red Alert time.
                   It is only used when talking about the duration you want
                   an activity to occur for, or to have some action occur
                   at a specified time in a mission.
 trigger          An action that Red Alert is to perform, either through a
                   computer player or independent of any player.
 trigger event    When talking about trigger events, we mean some [thing]
                   that has occurred in the Red Alert world (even something
                   as banal as a certain period of time passing). They are
                   actually tests made by Red Alert, to see if the condition
                   specified by the event is True.
 trigger action   When talking about trigger actions, we are talking about
                   the action that Red Alert is to take in response to a
                   fired trigger.



==================================
-SECTION TWO- SPECIFIC INFORMATION
==================================

------------------------------------
CHAPTER [4]  Mission File Components
------------------------------------

[4-1]  [Basic] Section
======================
    The [Basic] section of each mission ini file contains the following
  pieces of information (it doesn't have to contain all of these lines,
  but these are the valid ones):

  Name=
  Intro=
  Brief=
  Win=
  Lose=
  Action=
  Player=
  Theme=
  CarryOverMoney=
  ToCarryOver=
  ToInherit=
  TimerInherit=
  CivEvac=
  NewINIFormat=
  CarryOverCap=
  EndOfGame=
  NoSpyPlane=
  SkipScore=
  OneTimeOnly=
  SkipMapSelect=
  Official=
  FillSilos=
  TruckCrate=
  Percent=

These entries will now be explained in a bit more detail.

Name=...
--------
    This is used to give the mission a name.
    Default=none

Intro=...
---------
    This is the name of the video to play as the introduction movie to
  this level.  See Available Red Alert Movies for the list of possible
  movie names.
    A <none> means that no video is being used for the introduction movie.
    The introduction movie is played first (before the briefing and
  action movies).
    Default = <none>

Brief=...
---------
    This is the mission briefing movie for the level.  See Available Red
  Alert Movies for the list of possible movie names.
    A <none> means that no video is being used for the briefing movie.
    The briefing movie is played second (after the introduction movie but
  before the action movie).  If the user clicks on the mission briefing
  button and presses the Video button, this is the video that gets played.
    Default = <none>

Win=...
-------
    This is the movie that gets shown when you win the mission.  See
  Available Red Alert Movies for the list of possible movie names.
    A <none> means that no video is being used for the win movie.
    Default = <none>

Lose=...
--------
    This is the movie that gets shown when you lose the mission.  See
  Available Red Alert Movies for the list of possible movie names.
    A <none> means that no video is being used for the lose movie.
    Default = <none>

Action=...
----------
    This is the name of the video to play as the action movie for this
  level.  See Available Red Alert Movies for the list of possible movie
  names.
    A <none> means that no video is being used for the action movie.
    The action movie is played last (after the introduction and briefing
  movies).
    Default = <none>

Player=...
----------
    This tells the computer which country the user will be playing as
  during this mission.  See Available Red Alert Countries for the listing
  of available countries.  This uses the full name of the country, not the
  number or abbreviation.
    You should have a valid Player= section in your ini file.  If you do
  not have a Player= entry in this section, the player will default to
  Greece.

Theme=...
---------
    This is the piece of music to play at the start of the mission.  See
  Available Red Alert Songs for the listing of available music titles to
  play at the start.
    An entry of 'No theme' means that there is no specific music to play
  at the start of the mission, and that Red Alert should use the normal
  method of choosing which music to play.
    Default=none

CarryOverMoney=...
------------------
    This specifies that amount of money that will carry over to the mext
mission when you finish the current one. 1 stands for 100% of money, 0.5
stands for 50%, etc.

ToCarryOver=...
---------------
    If 'yes', units and structures at the (victorious) close of this
  mission will appear at the start of the next mission where
  "ToInherit=yes".  They will appear in the exact position and state of
  health they where left at the end of the mission.  Activities will not
  carry over.  Guard and harvest seem to be the defaults.  Aircraft in
  flight will vanish.

ToInherit=...
-------------
    If set to 'yes', see ToCarryOver (above).

TimerInherit=...
----------------
    This can have the value 'yes' or 'no'.
    When set to 'yes', the timer for this mission should start counting
  down from where it ended in the previous mission. Furthermore, as soon
  as the mission starts, the timer will be activated.
    When set to 'no', the counter is not transferred from the last mission.
    This value only needs to be set to 'yes' in the mission that is to
  have its time carried over to the next mission. The next mission should
  have this set to 'no', unless the timer for that mission is also to be
  carried over.

CivEvac=...
-----------
    This can have the value 'yes' and 'no'.
    When 'no', it means that transport helicopters do not take off when
  'civilian' units are loaded into them, unless there is a trigger for
  this action.
    When set to 'yes', transport helicopters will take off once 'civilian'
  units are loaded into them.
    This should actually be called 'TanyaEvac', as the only noticable
  difference when this is set to 'yes' is that the transport helicopter
  will take off when a Tanya unit enters.  If set to 'no', the transport
  helicopter will not take off when a Tanya unit enters.
    'Civilian' units does include the GNRL unit.

NewINIFormat=...
----------------
    If this item is not present with a valid value, the [Trigs] and
  [TeamTypes] sections will not be read.  0 is not valid.  3 is always
  used, and is the value inserted by Red Alert's terrain editor, which
  suggests it also has something to do with either the overlays
  (OverlayPack) or the map (MapPack)

    Setting NewINIFormat to 1 or 2 allows the use of the [Overlay]
  section rather than [OverlayPack].  At setting 1 the [Trigs] section
  will not be read.

CarryOverCap=...
----------------
    Related to "CarryOverMoney", it specifies the maximum amount of money
  that can be carried over from the previous mission.  As with the Credits
  entry, you multiply this value by 100 to get the real value.

EndOfGame=...
-------------
    This can be set to 'yes' or 'no'.
    When set to 'yes', when the player has won the mission, after they
  see the Win video, they get to see the Red Alert credits, and after
  that are taken back to the main menu.  The use of 'yes' for this item
  signifies that the campaign is finished.
    When set to 'no', the next mission is played, as usual.

NoSpyPlane=...
--------------
    This can be set to 'yes' or 'no'.
    When set to 'no', if the player has an airfield and a sufficiently
  high techlevel, then they will be able to use the spy plane.
    When set to 'yes', the spy plane will not appear on the side bar, even
  if the player has a sufficiently high techlevel.  The setting also
  affects the AI.

SkipScore=...
-------------
    This can be set to 'yes' or 'no'.
    When set to 'no', the player is treated to the score screen when he
  finishes the mission, where he will see how well he did in that
  mission (units killed, money finished with etc).
    When set to 'yes', the player does not get this score screen.

OneTimeOnly=...
---------------
    This can be set to 'yes' or 'no'.
    When set to 'yes', after the mission is won by the player, they are
  taken back to the main menu, as if they had finished the entire
  campaign.  This value does not mean that if the mission is failed that
  it cannot be retried - the player still gets the option to retry the
  mission if they fail.
    When set to 'no', winning the mission takes the player to the next
  mission in the campaign, as usual (if possible).

SkipMapSelect=...
-----------------
    This can be set to 'yes' or 'no'.
    When set to 'no', after the user has finished a mission, they are
  given the map of Europe and have to pick one of the flashing boxes for
  their next mission.
    When set to 'yes', the user does not see the map of Europe.  Instead,
  Red Alert loads up the next mission FOR THAT LEVEL.  This is very
  important: if the player just finished scg05ea, then scg05eb will be
  loaded, not scg06ea.  Note that you can do this even for those levels
  that only have a single 'official' mission, eg there is only 1 Soviet
  level 1 mission, but if you have an scu01eb.ini file present and this
  value set to 'yes', then level scu01eb will be started immediately after
  scu01ea is finished.  However, it doesn't appear that you can chain
  these indefinitely.  Adding an scu01ec.ini file didn't work - I would
  guess that the only place where a third would be accepted would be
  Allied mission 5, where there are already 3 missions (scg05ea eb and
  ec).
    It would be an unwise thing to have this set for an 'ea' mission if
  the map before gave the player a choice of playing either an 'ea' or
 'eb' mission, as they may choose the 'eb' mission, hence by-passing the
  first stage of the mission and possibly screwing up your storyline.  See
  Red Alert Mission Tree for the 'official' mission tree structure.
    A side effect of setting this to 'yes' is that the player does not get
  the 'Mission Accomplished' text on the screen - it just goes straight to
  the win video (if there is one).

Official=...
------------
    This is always set to 'yes' in the original Red Alert missions. 
  Giving it a value of 'no' does not seem to have any effect.

FillSilos=...
-------------
    This item can be set to 'yes' or 'no'.
    When set to 'yes', any country that has silos will have any starting
  money they have placed in the silos, rather than starting with those
  silos empty.  This is useful if you want the player/computer to use
  thieves at the very start of a mission, before the first harvester can
  come in.
    When set to 'no', the silos start empty at the beginning of the
  mission.

TruckCrate=...
--------------
    This item can be set to 'yes' or 'no'.
    When set to 'yes', when a convoy truck (TRUK) is destroyed, it leaves
  behind a crate with money in it (a WoodCrate, if you want to change what
  is in the crate).  Even trucks owned by the player drop crates when
  destroyed if this is set to 'yes'.
    When set to 'no', a destroyed convoy truck does not drop a crate.

Percent=...
-----------


[4-2]  [Map] Section
====================
    The [Map] section of the mission's ini file tells Red Alert the size
  and shape of the map that you are using.  It also tells Red Alert which
  tile set to use.  For a detailed description of cells and what the full
  map looks like, please read the section on Waypoints.  The following is
  a typical [Map] entry:
      [Map]
      Theater=SNOW
      X=32
      Y=32
      Width=64
      Height=64

Each section of the entry will be described below:

Theater=
--------
    This tells Red Alert which tile set to use.  The possible choices are
  SNOW, TEMPERATE and INTERIOR.  The three choices are self-explanatory in
  terms of the tile set they represent.
    Please note: the INTERIOR tile set is not used in Red Alert's terrain 
  editor, and if you change the Theater to INTERIOR and try to load up
  that map in the terrain editor, the editor will crash.

X=
--
    This tells Red Alert how far away from the left edge of the full map 
  the mission map starts.  This must always be at least 1.  The distance
  is the number of cells from the edge.

Y=
--
    This tell Red Alert how far away from the top edge of the full map the
  mission map starts.  This must always be at least 1.  The distance is
  the number of cells from the edge.

Width=
------
    This tells Red Alert the width of the mission map (in cells).  This
  width plus the X value plus 1 must NOT be more than 128.

Height=
-------
    This tells Red Alert the height of the mission map (in cells).  This
  height plus the Y value plus 1 must NOT be more than 128.

    Each map must have at least a 1 cell buffer around the edge of the
  mission map.  This means that X and Y must always have the value of at
  least 1, and that Width and Height must always have a value no greater
  than 126.  Note that while 126x126 maps are possible, Red Alert does not
  handle them well.


[4-3]  Country Specific Information
===================================
    For each country you have in your missions, whether they be in
  control of a large base or make a cameo role as a single civilian
  infantry unit, you should include some information about that country,
  even if it is nothing more than the allies of that country.
    To include country specific information into your ini file, you first
  take the name of a country (the full name), see Available Red Alert 
  Countries for this information, and place it within square brackets,
  such as [Spain], [Ukraine] and [England] for example.
    Under each of these headers, you then add the information that you
  want to pertain to that country.

    The available pieces of information that you can include as country
  specific information seem to be the following (given through an example
  of a complete entry):

      [Greece]
      Credits=12
      Edge=South
      MaxUnit=50
      MaxInfantry=50
      MaxBuilding=10
      MaxVessel=10
      TechLevel=10
      IQ=3
      Allies=USSR,Turkey
      PlayerControl=yes      
      Firepower=1.0
      Groundspeed=1.0
      Airspeed=1.0
      Armor=1.0
      ROF=1.0
      Cost=1.0
      BuildTime=1.0

These will now be explained in more detail:

Credits
-------
    This is the amount of starting cash for that country for the mission.
  To get the real amount of cash, multiply the value by 100 (ie a value of
  12 means that that country starts with 1200 cash).
    This is cash-in-hand, unless the FillSilos variable (in the [Basic] 
  section) is set to yes, in which case the cash is stored in any
  available silos or refineries.

Edge
----
    The available values are North, East, South and West.  Contrary to 
  intuition, this does not control the direction from which reinforcements
  will arrive.  In fact, it doesn't seem to do anything.  Probably a
  relic from C&C where it did control the direction of reinforcements.

MaxUnits, MaxInfantry, MaxBuilding, MaxVessel
---------------------------------------------
    I'd guess that it limits the number of vehicles, buildings, ships and
  infantry units the country can have on the map at one time.  Unknown
  whether it overrides the values from the rules.ini file.
    Untested as yet.

TechLevel
---------
    Each building and unit has an associated tech. level at which it can
  be built; to be able to build it, the country needs to have a tech.
  level of at least that level.
    This is mainly used to control what the human player can build in the
  mission.

IQ
--
    This sets the IQ level of the country.  It would be unwise to set the
  human's country to any IQ level but 0 (which is the default for human
  controlled countries), as the computer would then be controlling the
  human's buildings and units.
    See Discussion on IQ Levels for more on how IQ levels affect a game.

Allies
------
    This is a comma separated list (ie GoodGuy,Greece,Germany,USSR) of the
  countries that this country will treat as friends and not attack. 
  Please note that this is not automatically reciprocated, in that if you
  don't want two countries attacking each other, you have to correctly
  set the allies field for both country specific information entries.
    You use the full name of the country in this list.

PlayerControl
-------------
    By default this is set to 'no'.  However, if it is set to 'yes', then
  the human player will be able to control the units of this country.  The
  human player will not own these units, but will be able to direct their
  movement, etc.
    In addition to being controllable by the human player, when these
  units move (whether by being controlled by the human or the computer),
  they remove the shroud from the map as the human's own units would. 
  Any buildings of this country also remove the shroud around them as if
  they were owned by the player.
    A player cannot use the buildings of this country for construction.


[4-4]  [STRUCTURES] Section
===========================
    The [STRUCTURES] section contains those buildings which you want to
  appear on the map at the beginning of the mission.  See Available Red
  Alert Structures for the list of building abbreviations.  The following
  is a typical entry:

      0=USSR,TSLA,256,7623,0,None,1,0

    The format of a [STRUCTURES] entry is:
      num=country,type,health,cell,facing,trig,???,repair

Each section of the entry will be described below:

num
---
    This is the number of the structure.  While it probably isn't
  necessary, the numbering starts at 0 and increments from there.  You
  cannot have two buildings with the same number (the latter will replace
  the former).

country
-------
    This contains the owner of the structure.  See Available Red Alert
  Countries for the list of country names.  You place the full name here,
  not the abbreviation.

type
----
    This contains the type of building to place on the map.  See Available
  Red Alert Buildings for the list of building abbreviations (you use the
  abbreviation of the building name).  Unlike the original C&C, all
  buildings can appear in all terrain types, except for those noted in
  Available Red Alert Buildings.

health
------
    This is the condition that the building starts in, on a scale of 1 to
  256.  Treat this as a percentage, with 256 being 100%, 128 being 50%,
  etc.  Remember that some units and buildings have very small amounts of
  hit points, so it may not be possible to give them the full range of
  numbers (a civilian infantry unit with 5 hit points will only have 2 at
  50% and 1 at 25%, roughly)

cell
----
    The upper left hand corner of the building is the anchor cell of that
  building.  This value contains a cell number into which you want Red
  Alert to place the anchor of the specified building.

facing
------
    This is only useful for those structures which can track enemies (gun
  turrets, anti-aircraft guns, and SAM sites); it is the direction you
  want the particular structure to face at the beginning of the mission.
  The following are the basic directions these buildings can point to: 0 -
  North (the top of the screen), 64 - East (right hand side of the
  screen), 128 - South (bottom of the screen), and 192 - West (left hand
  side of the screen).  You can also have a few positions in between these
  stages; the numbering goes in steps of 16 (ie valid numbers are 0, 16,
  32, 48, 64, etc), with the initial facing of the turret changing with
  the appropriate value.
    Picture a clock face, and you will more easily be able to picture the
  direction the turreted building will face in at the beginning of the 
  mission.

trig
----
    The name of a trigger to attach to the building.  If you want to
  attach a trigger to a building, place the name of the trigger you
  want to attach in this position.  If you don't want a trigger associated
  with the building, set this value to None.

??(unknown)??
-------------
    Don't know what this is for.

repair
------
    This number indicates whether the building will be repaired or
  not, provided that the computer player has a sufficiently high IQ level
  (normally this would be an IQ level of 1 or more, but this may vary if
  you have changed the [IQ] section of the rules.ini file).  A value of 1
  means it will be repaired. A value of 0 mean it won't be repaired.

    As well as acting as a repairable 'switch', this value also acts as a
  rebuild 'switch'.  The CP will rebuild this building once it is
  destroyed, as long as Production has been turned on and it is in
  possession of a construction yard.  Also, it seems that once the
  building is rebuilt this way, the AI will not repair it!
    However, this will only work if that CP has their country in the
  [Base] section of the file. That list could have a Count=0, just so long
  as the Player= is set to the CP's country.


[4-5]  [SHIPS] Section
======================
    This section contains the ships that you want to appear on the map at
  the beginning of the mission.  See Available Red Alert Ships for the
  abbreviations of the ship types that you can use here.  A typical entry
  would look like:

      0=Greece,DD,256,9265,192,Guard,None

    The format of a [SHIPS] entry is:
      num=country,type,health,cell,facing,action,trig

Each section of the entry will be described below:

num
---
    This is the number of the ship.  While it probably isn't necessary,
  the numbering starts at 0 and increments from there.  You cannot have
  two ships with the same number (the later will replace the former).

country
-------
    This contains the owner of the ship.  See Available Red Alert
  Countries for the list of country names.  You place the full name here,
  not the abbreviation.

type
----
    This contains the type of ship to place on the map.  See Available Red
  Alert Ships for the list of ship abbreviations (you use the abbreviation
  of the ship name).

health
------
    This is the condition that the ship starts in, on a scale of 1 to 256.
  Treat this as a percentage, with 256 being 100%, 128 being 50%, etc.
  Remember that some units and buildings have very small amounts of hit 
  points, so it may not be possible to give them the full range of numbers
  (a civilian infantry unit with 5 hit points will only have 2 at 50% and
  1 at 25%, roughly)

cell
----
    This value contains the cell value into which you wish Red Alert to
  place the ship.

facing
------
    This value it is the direction you want the ship to face at the
  beginning of the mission.  The following are the basic directions in
  which a ship can face: 0 - North (the top of the screen), 64 - East
  (right hand side of the screen), 128 - South (bottom of the screen), and
  192 - West (left hand side of the screen).  You can also have a few
  positions in between these stages; the numbering goes in steps of 16 (ie
  valid numbers are 0, 16, 32, 48, 64, etc), with the initial facing of
  the ship changing with the appropriate value.
    Picture a clock face, and you will more easily be able to picture the
  direction the ship will be facing at the beginning of the mission.

action
------
    This is the action that you want the ship to perform at the beginning
  of the mission.  The ship will continue to perform this action until it
  is told to do something else (by either the player or the computer), is
  destroyed, or the action can no longer be performed.  See Available
  Initial Unit Commands for the list of commands a unit can be given.
    Set this to None if you don't want the ship to perform any action at
  the beginning of the mission.
    The most common use would be to set the ship to either Guard, Area
  Guard, Hunt or None.

trig
----
    The name of a trigger to attach to the ship.  If you want to attach a
  trigger to a ship, you place the name of the trigger you want to attach
  in this position.  If you don't want a trigger associated with the ship,
  set this value to None.


[4-6]  [INFANTRY] Section
=========================
    This section contains the infantry units that you want to appear on
  the map at the beginning of the mission.  See Available Red Alert
  Infantry Units for the abbreviations of the infantry types you can use
  here.  The following is a typical entry:

      0=Greece,E1,256,6977,2,Sticky,64,None

    The format of an [INFANTRY] entry is:

      num=country,type,health,cell,sub_cell,action,facing,trig

Each section of the entry will be described below:

num
---
    This is the number of the infantry entry.  While it probably isn't
  necessary, the numbering starts at 0 and increments from there.  You
  cannot have two infantry entries with the same number (the latter will
  replace the former).

country
-------
    This contains the owner of the infantry unit.  See Available Red Alert
  Countries for the list of country names.  You place the full name here,
  not the abbreviation.

type
----
    This contains the type of infantry unit to place on the map.  See
  Available Red Alert Infantry Units for the list of infantry
  abbreviations (you use the abbreviation of the infantry name).

health
------
    This is the condition that the infantry unit starts in, on a scale of
  1 to 256.  Treat this as a percentage, with 256 being 100%, 128 being
  50%, etc.  Remember that some units and buildings have very small
  amounts of hit points, so it may not be possible to give them the full
  range of numbers (a civilian infantry unit with 5 hit points will only
  have 2 at 50% and 1 at 25%, roughly)

cell
----
    This value contains the cell value into which you wish Red Alert to
  place the infantry unit.

sub_cell
--------
    For infantry units, each cell is divided up into 5 sub-cells.  It is
  these sub-cells that allow five infantry units to be located in one
  cell.  The locations of the sub-cells within the main cell is:
     1   2    <--- top of cell
       0      <--- middle of cell
     3   4    <--- bottom of cell
    This value holds the number of the sub-cell into which you want to
  place the infantry unit.  If you are placing more than one infantry unit
  within the same cell, you must make sure that their sub-cells are
  different.
    Infantry units are the only units that use sub-cells.

action
------
    This is the action that you want the infantry units to perform at the
  beginning of the mission.  The infantry unit will continue to perform
  this action until it is told to do something else (by either the player
  or the computer), is destroyed, or the action can no longer be
  performed.  See the section Available Initial Unit Commands for the list
  of commands a unit can be given.
    Set this to None if you don't want the infantry unit to perform any
  action at the beginning of the mission.
    The most common use would be to set the infantry unit to either Guard,
  Area Guard, Hunt or None.

facing
------
    This value it is the direction you want the infantry unit to face at
  the beginning of the mission.  The following are the basic directions to
  which a unit can face: 0 - North (the top of the screen), 64 - East
  (right hand side of the screen), 128 - South (bottom of the screen), and
  192 - West (left hand side of the screen).  You can also have a few
  positions in between these stages; the numbering goes in steps of 16 (ie
  valid numbers are 0, 16, 32, 48, 64, etc), with the initial facing of
  the infantry unit changing with the appropriate value.
    Picture a clock face, and you will more easily be able to picture the
  direction the infantry unit will be facing at the beginning of the
  mission.

trig
----
    The name of a trigger to attach to the infantry unit.  If you want to
  attach a trigger to an infantry unit, place the name of the trigger
  you want to attach in this position.  If you don't want a trigger
  associated with the infantry unit, set this value to None.


[4-7]  [UNITS] Section
======================
    This section contains the vehicles that you want to appear on the map
  at the beginning of the mission.  See Available Red Alert Vehicles for
  the abbreviations of the vehicles types that you can use here.  A
  typical entry would look like:
      0=Greece,1TNK,256,8246,96,Sticky,None

    The format of a [UNITS] entry is:
      num=country,type,health,cell,facing,action,trig

Each section of the entry will be described below:

num
---
    This is the number of the vehicle.  While it probably isn't
  necessary, the numbering starts at 0 and increments from there.  You
  cannot have two vehicles with the same number (the latter will replace
  the former).

country
-------
    This contains the owner of the vehicle.  See Available Red Alert
  Countries for the list of country names.  You place the full name here,
  not the abbreviation.

type
----
    This contains the type of vehicle to place on the map.  See Available
  Red Alert Vehicles for the list of vehicle abbreviations (you use the
  abbreviation of the vehicle name).

health
------
    This is the condition that the vehicle starts in, on a scale of 1 to
  256.  Treat this as a percentage, with 256 being 100%, 128 being 50%,
  etc.  Remember that some units and buildings have very small amounts of
  hit points, so it may not be possible to give them the full range of
  numbers (a civilian infantry unit with 5 hit points will only have 2 at
  50% and 1 at 25%, roughly)

cell
----
    This value contains the cell value into which you wish Red Alert to
  place the vehicle.

facing
------
    This value is the direction you want the vehicle to face at the 
  beginning of the mission.  The following are the basic directions in
  which a vehicle can face: 0 - North (the top of the screen), 64 - East
  (right hand side of the screen), 128 - South (bottom of the screen), and
  192 - West (left hand side of the screen).  You can also have a few
  positions in between these stages; the numbering goes in steps of 16 (ie
  valid numbers are 0, 16, 32, 48, 64, etc), with the initial facing of
  the vehicle changing with the appropriate value.
    Picture a clock face, and you will more easily be able to picture the
  direction the vehicle will be facing at the beginning of the mission.

action
------
    This is the action that you want the vehicle to perform at the
  beginning of the mission.  The vehicle will continue to perform this
  action until it is told to do something else (by either the player or
  the computer), is destroyed, or the action can no longer be performed.
  See Available Initial Unit Commands for the list of commands a unit can
  be given.
    Set this to None if you don't want the vehicle to perform any action
  at the beginning of the mission.
    The most common use would be to set the vehicle to either Guard, Area
  Guard, Hunt or None.

trig
----
    The name of a trigger to attach to the vehicle.  If you want to attach
  a trigger to a vehicle, place the name of the trigger you want to
  attach in this position.  If you don't want a trigger associated with
  the vehicle, set this value to None.


[4-8]  [TERRAIN] Section
========================
    This section contains various terrain features, such as trees that you
  have placed around the map.  Most of these items can be placed in the
  Red Alert terrain editor.

    A typical [TERRAIN] entry would be:  
      7102=T14
      9107=MINE

    Each entry in the [TERRAIN] section has the format: 
      cell=type

cell
----
    This is the cell in which the terrain feature is to be anchored.

type
----
    This is the type of terrain feature to place in the specified cell.
  For the list of available terrain types and the theaters they appear in,
  see Available Terrain Types.


[4-9]  [SMUDGE] Section
=======================
    Additional terrain effects are available in Red Alert, in the form of
  craters and scorch marks.  To place these effects on the map, you must
  use the [SMUDGE] section.  See Available Smudge Types for a listing of
  the various types of smudge graphics that are available.  A typical
  [SMUDGE] section would look like:
      [SMUDGE]
      7723=CR1,7723,3
      7724=SC1,7724,0

    Each entry in the [SMUDGE] section has the format:
      cell=type,cell2,depth

Each section of the entry will be described below

cell
----
    This is the cell in which you want the smudge effect to be placed.
  However, it seems as though this can be overridden if the cell2 value is
  different from this value.

type
----
    This is the type of smudge mark to place in the cell.  See Available
  Smudge Types for a listing of the types of smudge graphics that are
  available.

cell2
-----
    I honestly do not know what this is for.  Every example I have seen
  has this value equal to the first cell, and whenever I have put a
  different cell value in this position, the smudge would be drawn at this
  position instead of the first.

depth
-----
    Not an accurate description of what this variable is actually used
  for.  It can have values from 0 to 3, but cannot be used for the SC type
  of smudge effect. For the SC smudges, always set this value to 0
  (otherwise strange graphics glitches occur).
    When this value is set to 0, the normal graphic for the smudge is 
  displayed, but when this value is greater than zero, the graphic is
  changed slightly.  This new graphic depicts a larger crater, the higher
  the number the larger the crater (in a very rough sense).  A value of 3
  seems to be the highest value that this can take.
    Note that this effect is more pronounced for some crater types than
  others.
    When the smudge effect is a BIB, and this value is greater than 0, it
  seems as though part of the bib graphic is painted over the bib graphic
  as it is laid down.  I would recommend not using any number other than 0
  if you want to put down a BIB.


[4-10]  [Base] Section
======================
    The [Base] section is interesting and useful for a number of reasons.
  The purpose of the [Base] section is to tell the Red Alert computer
  players which buildings they must replace if they get destroyed, and
  where they should be placing these buildings.  If the computer player is
  of sufficiently high IQ (an IQ level of 5 unless you have manually
  changed it), then it will be placing its own buildings on the map, but
  you can specify in this section buildings which it must place on the
  map.
    A typical [Base] entry would look like:
      Player=Greece
      Count=2
      000=GUN,7463
      001=GUN,7461
    The Player= is used to determine which computer controlled country
  these buildings are specifying.  Because you can have more than one
  computer controlled country in a mission, this is used so that the wrong
  computer country doesn't build the structure.  In the original C&C, the
  [Base] entry did not have this functionality, and hence you often ended
  up with the computer players constructing buildings in each other's
  bases.
    The Count= is used to specify the number of entries in this particular
  section.  If you do not wish to have a [Base] section, set count to 0.
  If you just have one entry, set it to 1, etc.
    Each entry has the following type:
    num=type,cell

num
---
    This is the number of the [Base] entry.  It must be a 3 digit number,
  starting at 000, and incrementing by 1 for each additional entry.  Do
  not have repeated numbers.

type
----
    This is the type of building that you want the computer player to
  build.  See Available Red Alert Buildings for the list of abbreviations
  to use in this area of the entry.

cell
----
    This specifies the cell at which you want the building to be placed.
  It is the building's anchor cell (the top left cell of the smallest
  rectangle enclosing the building's graphic).

    If the anchor cell is obstructed, indeed if any part of the area of
  land the building needs is obstructed, then the building will not be
  constructed.
    As soon as the computer player has had its Production turned on, it
  will begin construction of these buildings.

    Apart from just replacing destroyed buildings, this section can also
  be used to get a computer player to expand their base.  The buildings
  mentioned in the [Base] section do not need to exist on the map at the
  beginning of the mission.  You could, for example, construct an entire
  base for a computer player but instead of placing it in the [Structures]
  section, you could place it in the [Base] section.  When that computer
  player gets a construction yard, money and a Production order, it will
  begin constructing this base.

    There is no way of having multiple [Base] entries for different
  computer controlled countries.  This is a shame, as it means you can't
  be creative and create multiple computer controlled bases from scratch.

    The order in which the buildings appear in the [Base] section 
  determines the order in which they will be built (ie 000 will be built
  first, 001 second etc).


[4-11]  [Waypoints] Section
===========================
    Waypoints are used in Red Alert for a number of things, but the most
  common is to determine the movement of units.  A waypoint is simply a
  cell that has been identified as having some significance, and that has
  been given an alias.
    Waypoint 98 determines which section of the mission map to display at
  the beginning of the mission. Choose this carefully, since the DOS and
  Win95 versions show different amounts of the map. A waypoint that 
  works in DOS may be too close to the map edge for Win95, causing a 
  wrap-around to the far edge in Win95.
    A typical [Waypoints] section will look like:
      [Waypoints]
      1=10298
      5=9077
      98=5063

    Each entry has the format:
      alias=cell

alias
-----
    The alias of a waypoint is simply a number.  This number cannot be
  less than 0, nor greater than 99.
    You cannot have multiple instances of the same alias for waypoints,
  but you do not have to keep the alias you use in order.  You could, for
  example, use waypoints 0, 1, 2, 30, 35, 40 and 98, and there would be no
  problems.

cell
----
    This is the cell of the map for which you want to create the alias.

A further description of cells and how they relate to the map follows.

    The full Red Alert map is a 128 by 128 square, using cells as the
  measurement.  The map would look something like this:

      +--------------------+    -+-
      |                    |     |
      |                    |     |
      |                    |   128 cells
      |                    |   in height
      |                    |     |
      |                    |     |
      +--------------------+    -+-
      
      |                    |
      +--- 128 cells in ---+
      |       width        |

    However, because of the requirement that each map have at least a 1
  cell buffer around the entire edge of the map, the maximum mission map
  size is 126 by 126.  This full map now looks like the following:

      **********************    -+-         *'s represent part of the
      *+------------------+*     |          full map that are not part
      *|        |         |*     |          of the mission map.
      *|    126 cells     |*   128 cells
      *|    in height     |*   in height    In this particular case, the
      *|        |         |*     |          full map has a single cell
      *+------------------+*     |          boundary around the mission map.
      **********************    -+-
       |--- 126 cells  ---|
      |      in width      |
      +--- 128 cells in ---+
      |       width        |

    You can have any combination of width and height, provided that you
  obey the rule that you must have at least a single cell boundary around
  the mission map.  You could have, for example, the following: map height
  of 50 cells, map width of 60 cells, 30 cells from the left, 10 cells
  from the top.  The map would look like:

      **********************    10    -+-
      ********************** ---       |
      *******        *******  |        |
      *******        *******  50     128 cells
      *******        *******  |      in height
      ********************** ---       |
      **********************    68     |
      **********************    ---   -+-
      | 30  |       |  38  |
            |   60  |
      
      |                    |
      +--- 128 cells in ---+
      |       width        |

    Not the prettiest of diagrams, but you should be able to see what I am
  trying to explain. 

    It is easy to determine the cell numbering.  The first row in the map
  is numbered from 0 to 127.  The second row is numbered from 128 to 255,
  etc. Use the formula:
      row_number*128 + column_number
  to determine the cell numbering.
    Hence, the top left corner of the full map will be 0 (this will never
  be on any map).


[4-12]  [CellTriggers] Section
==============================
    Celltriggers are used to place various triggers around the map, that
  will be fired when the units of some country enter the specified cell.
  A typical [CellTriggers] entry looks like:
      [CellTriggers]
      10204=kill
      9076=bob1
      9077=bob1

    Each entry in the [CellTriggers] section has the format:
      cell=trigger

cell
----
    This is the cell into which you wish to place the trigger.

trigger
-------
    This is the trigger that you want to place into the specified cell.
  The name of the trigger must be at most 4 characters in length.  The
  most common form of triggers that are used as celltriggers are those
  that have Player Enters as their trigger event.

    You cannot have more than one trigger per cell.


[4-13]  [Trigs] Section
=======================
    This is the most important part of the ini file, for it determines how
  the mission will pan out.  It sets the win and lose conditions, and also
  controls (to some extent) the way the computer opponents will behave.  I
  say 'to some extent' because with Red Alert, Westwood has introduced the
  notion of giving the computer players some autonomy of the triggers in
  the form of variable IQ levels (see Discussion of IQ Levels for more on
  this subject).


[4-13-1]  Trigger Information
=============================
    A trigger (in the [Trigs] section of the ini file has the following
  format:
        name=1,2,h,i,T1,p1,p2,T2,p1,p2,R1,p1,p2,p3,R2,p1,p2,p3

Each section of the trigger is described below:

name
----
    This is simply a name to describe the trigger.  It seems as though
  there is a maximum trigger name length of 4 characters if you want to
  use a particular trigger as a celltrigger.  There is probably a limit to
  the length of a non-celltrigger trigger name, so it is probably best to
  keep the name to a maximum lenght of 6 or 7 letter.  The name can be any
  combination of letters and numbers, and other symbols (+, _ etc), but
  not a 'space' character.

1 (repeatable)
--------------
    The first number tells RA whether this is a repeating trigger or not.
  If it has the value 0, then the trigger will only ever be activated once
  (not strictly true as the trigger can be fired again if associated with
  a teamtype).  If it has a value greater than 0, then the trigger is a
  repeating trigger (ie it will be fired more than once).
    For repeating triggers, there are two types.  When the repeating
  trigger has a value of 1, the trigger will only occur once the trigger
  event has happened to all items (units and buildings) to which this
  trigger has been attached.  This is useful if you want, for example,
  some action to occur after a specific set of buildings have been
  destroy.
    The second type of repeating trigger is the free repeater.  When this
  item has the value of 2, it will continue to repeat itself whenever its
  trigger event is true.  This is of use if you want, for example, to have
  the trigger activate every 20 time units.

2 (which country trigger applies to)
------------------------------------
    If the trigger event requires a country to be specified, then, in some
  cases, this holds the country number.  Refer to the specific trigger
  actions as to which actions require this field to be filled in
  correctly.  Still, it is probably better to put the correct country in
  here in any case, even if only to make it clearer which country this
  trigger is being used for.
    See Available Red Alert Countries for a listing of country numbers.

h (when to activate trigger)
----------------------------
    When 0, only the first trigger event (part 5) must be true for the
  trigger to be activated.
    When 1, the first (part 5) and second (part 8) must both be true for
  the trigger to be activated.
    When 2, either the first trigger event or the second trigger event
  must be true, whichever comes first.
    When 3, either the first trigger event or the second trigger event
  must be true.
    See the upcoming summary (next) for further details on how this
  operates.

i (which actions are triggered)
-------------------------------
    When 0, only one trigger action is activated when the event is
  triggered.  See the summary (next) for which trigger action is
  activated, and when.
    When 1, both trigger actions are activated when the event is
  triggered.

Summary: Combinations of trigger events and trigger actions
-----------------------------------------------------------
  h,i
  0,0   T1 -> R1
  0,1   T1 -> R1 and R2
  1,0   T1 and T2 -> R1
  1,1   T1 and T2 -> R1 and R2
  2,0   T1 or T2 -> R1
  2,1   T1 or T2 -> R1 and R2
  3,0   T1 -> R1, or T2 -> R2

   Now, in words:
  0,0   T1 true to activate R1
  0,1   T1 true to activate R1 and R2
  1,0   T1 and T2 true to activate R1
  1,1   T1 and T2 true to activate R1 and R2
  2,0   T1 or T2 true to activate R1 (whichever comes first)
  2,1   T1 or T2 true to activate R1 and R2 (whichever comes first)
  3,0   T1 true to activate R1, or T2 true to activate R2 

    If either T1 or T2 are time dependent and the trigger is a repeating
  trigger, then the test for time passage is measured from the last firing
  of any part of the trigger.

T1 (first trigger event)
-----------------------
    This is the first event that will cause this trigger to fire.  For a
  list of trigger events, see Available Trigger Events.
    Set to 0 if you don't want a first trigger event (for example, when
  you will be forcing the trigger).

p1 (first parameter)
--------------------
    This is called the first parameter when discussing trigger events. 
  Set to -1 if it is not needed.

p2 (second parameter)
---------------------
    This is called the second parameter when discussing trigger events. 
  Set to -1 if it is not needed.
    Additional note: In Westwood's original missions, this is set to 0
  when not used.  I have personally never seen a problem arise from using
  -1 instead of 0, but it may be wise to set this to 0 when it is not
  needed.

T2 (second trigger event)
------------------------
    This is the second event that will cause this trigger to fire.  For a
  list of trigger events, see Available Trigger Events.
    Set to 0 if you don't want a second trigger event.

p1 (first parameter)
--------------------
    This is called the first parameter when discussing trigger events. 
  Set to -1 if it is not needed.

p2 (second parameter)
---------------------
    This is called the second parameter when discussing trigger events.
  Set to -1 if it is not needed.
    Additional note: In Westwood's original missions, this is set to 0
  when not used.  I have personally never seen a problem arise from using
  -1 instead of 0, but it may be wise to set this to 0 when it is not
  needed.

R1 (first trigger action)
-------------------------
    This number holds the first trigger action.  This action will occur
  when the trigger event(s) has occurred.  For a list of available trigger
  actions, see Available Trigger Actions.

p1 (first parameter)
--------------------
    This is referred to as the first parameter when talking about trigger
  actions (see Available Trigger Actions).
    Set to -1 if it is not needed.

p2 (second parameter)
---------------------
    This is referred to as the second parameter when talking about trigger
  actions (see Available Trigger Actions).
    Set to -1 if it is not needed.

p3 (third parameter)
--------------------
    This is referred to as the third parameter when talking about trigger
  actions (see Available Trigger Actions).
    Set to -1 if it is not needed.

R2 (second trigger action)
--------------------------
    If this trigger has more than one trigger action associated with an
  event, then the second trigger action is held here.  It has the same
  possible values as the first trigger action (see Available Trigger
  Actions for the full listing).
    Set this value to 0 if you don't want this trigger to have a secondary
  trigger action.

p1 (first parameter)
--------------------
    This is referred to as the first parameter when talking about trigger
  actions (see Available Trigger Actions).
    Set to -1 if it is not needed.

p2 (second parameter)
---------------------
    This is referred to as the second parameter when talking about trigger
  actions (see Available Trigger Actions).
    Set to -1 if it is not needed.

p3 (third parameter)
--------------------
    This is referred to as the third parameter when talking about trigger
  actions (see Available Trigger Actions).
    Set to -1 if it is not needed.

Descriptions of how these trigger events operate follows:

0     No Event
--------------
    Used to denote that this trigger is never activated (there is no
  event that will cause this to be activated). 
    It takes no parameters.
    This is of use when you want to have a trigger that will be fired by
  another trigger, but that you don't otherwise want fired.

1     Entered by
----------------
    Used to have a trigger occur when a player moves a unit into the
  cell.
    This can also be used as a 'Captured by' trigger when placed on a
  structure (ie it will get fired when the building is taken over by
  engineers).
    The country is specified in the second parameter.

2     Spied by
--------------
    This trigger must be attached to a structure for it to work.  When a
  spy infiltrates the structure, the trigger will be fired.  It does not
  appear to need a country associated with it; setting the second
  parameter to -1 will still cause this trigger to be fired when the
  player spies upon this building (as will setting the second parameter to
  any other value).
    Remember, some buildings can't normally be spied upon, but this can be
  changed by setting Capturable=yes in the building's entry (see Changing
  Red Alert Values for further information on this).
    It doesn't seem to need any parameters.

3     Thieved by
----------------
    Cannot seem to get it to work.

4     Discovered by player
--------------------------
    This trigger must be attached to something (a structure or some type
  of unit) for it to be activated.  When the player first encounters this
  unit/structure, the trigger will be activated.  Encountered means
  getting a unit in close enough so that the unit/structure is revealed.
    This cannot be associated with a specific country, as only the player
  can fire this trigger.  You don't have to specify the player's country,
  nor does this event require any parameters. 

5     House Discovered
----------------------
    This trigger does not need to be associated with anything.  It takes
  one parameter (the second parameter), which is the number of the country
  with which to associate this trigger.  When the country specified by the
  parameter is discovered, this trigger will fire.  Only the player can
  fire this trigger, as the visual range of the player and AI countries
  are co-extensive.

6     Attacked by anybody
-------------------------
    This trigger must be attached to something (a structure or some type
  of unit) for it to be activated.  When this unit/structure is attacked,
  the trigger is fired.  It does not matter which country does the
  attacking.
    It takes no parameters.

7     Destroyed by anybody
--------------------------
    This trigger must be attached to something (structure or some type of
  unit) for it to get activated.  When the attached item is destroyed, by
  any country, this trigger will activate.
    It requires no parameters.

8     Any event
---------------
    This trigger gets fired when any event at all is met.  This may be
  handy for setting mission start conditions, as it will always be fired
  as soon as the mission begins.
    It takes no parameters.

9     Destroyed, Units, All
---------------------------
    This trigger gets fired when all the units of the specified country
  are destroyed.  Units include vehicles and infantry.
    The country is specified in the second parameter.
    Loaded LSTs (when they are not under control) are not included in this
  check.

10    Destroyed, Buildings, All
-------------------------------
    This trigger gets fired when all the structures of the specified
  country have been destroyed.  Please note that civilian structures are
  not counted for this (ie V05 etc).
    The country is specified in the second parameter.

11    Destroyed, All
--------------------
    This trigger gets fired when all the units and structures of the
  specified country have been destroyed.  In essence, it is a combination
  of events 9 and 10.  Like event 10, civilian structures are not counted
  for this (ie V05 etc).
    The country is specified in the second parameter.

12    Credits exceed
--------------------
    When the number of credits currently held exceeds the value in the
  second parameter, this trigger is activated.  The second parameter is
  the _actual_ number of credits to be exceeded (eg. 5000).
    The team for which the credits are tested against is held in
  part 2 of the trigger.

13    Elapsed time (1/10th min)
-------------------------------
    When the current time of the mission has passed the value in the
  second parameter divided by 10, this trigger is activated.

14    Mission timer expired
---------------------------
    This trigger gets fired when the global timer has reached zero.  It
  takes no parameters (so set them to -1).

15    Destroyed, Buildings, #
-----------------------------
    This trigger gets fired when the specified number of buildings have
  been destroyed.  Unlike the Destroyed, All and Destroyed, Buildings, All
  trigger events, civilian buildings are included in the count for this
  event.
    The second parameter holds the number of buildings that need to be 
  destroyed.
    To specify which country's buildings we are talking about, you must
  set part 2 of the trigger (which country the trigger applies to) to the 
  appropriate country number.
    The first parameter is not used (set it to -1).

16    Destroyed, Units, #
-------------------------
    This trigger gets fired when the specified number of units have been
  destroyed.
    The second parameter holds the number of units that need to be
  destroyed.
    To specify which country's units we are talking about, you must set
  part 2 of the trigger to the appropriate country number.
    The first parameter is not used (set it to -1).

17    No factories left
-----------------------
    When the specified country has no "factories" left, this trigger will
  be fired.  In Red Alert, a "factory" includes: construction yard (FACT),
  air field (AFLD), barracks (BARR and TENT), and weapons factory (WEAP).
  Helicopter pads (HPAD), dog kennels (KENN), ship yards (SYRD) and sub
  pens (SPEN) are not counted as a "factory".
    To specify which country's "factories" we are talking about, you must
  set part 2 of the trigger to the appropriate country number.
    This trigger event does not use any parameters, so set them to -1.

18    Civilians evacuated
-------------------------
    When a civilian infantry unit leaves the map, this trigger will
  fire.  Civilian units will leave the map when put into transport
  helicopters.  There seem to be two classes of civilian units, those that
  obey the CivEvac entry in the [Basic] section, and those that do not. 
    More work needs to be done do determine whether this can be fired by
  APCs and LSTs as well, and to determine which civilian units fall into
  which class.
    This does not take any parameters (set them to -1).  However, you
  need to set part 2 of the trigger to point to the country of the
  civilian unit that will fire this trigger (see Available Red Alert
  Countries for the numbers of the various countries).

19    Build building type
-------------------------
    The trigger is activated when the specified building is constructed.
  For the list of available buildings in Red Alert and their associated
  numbers, see Available Red Alert Buildings.  Note that constructed means
  placed on the map, not just purchased but placed.
    The building number is placed in the second parameter.

20    Build unit type
---------------------
    The trigger is activated when the specified vehicle is constructed.
  Ships are not considered to be a vehicle by Red Alert (indeed, there is
  no way to have a trigger fire on the construction of a ship type).  For
  the list of available vehicle types and their associated numbers,
  see Available Red Alert Vehicles.
    The unit number is placed in the second parameter.

21    Build infantry type
-------------------------
    The trigger is activated when the specified infantry unit is
  constructed.
    The attack dog is an infantry type.  For the list of available 
  infantry types in Red Alert and the numbers associated with them, 
  see Available Red Alert Infantry Units  
    The infantry number is placed in the second parameter.

22    Build aircraft type
-------------------------
    The trigger is activated when the specified aircraft is constructed.
  For the list of available aircraft types in Red Alert and their
  associated numbers, see Available Red Alert Aircraft.
    Note that the use of the spy plane, parabombs or paradrop by the
  player will not cause this trigger to be activated, as this isn't seen
  to be building the aircraft by Red Alert.
    The aircraft number is placed in the second parameter.

23    Leaves map (team)
-----------------------
    The trigger is activated when the specified teamtype leaves the map.
  A teamtype can be programmed to leave the map by having a Move action
  that specifies a destination that is off the mission map.
    The first parameter takes the number of the teamtype that is set to
  leave the map.  Remember that teamtype numbering starts from 0.

24    Zone entry by
-------------------
    Another trigger that seems to only be usable in celltriggers.  When
  the "zone" of the cell to which this trigger action is attached is
  entered, the trigger gets fired.
    The second parameter takes the number of the country which will
  activate the trigger when it enters the "zone".
    The real question becomes (for this trigger event and the trigger
  action Reveal zone of waypoint): what is the "zone"?  See the What is
  the Zone of a cell? section for an explanation of the "zone".

25    Crosses horizontal line
-----------------------------
    Cannot seem to get it to work.  Have tried passing waypoints and
  absolute cells as parameters, but nothing works.  This is not used
  in any of the original Red Alert missions.

26    Crosses vertical line
---------------------------
    Cannot seem to get it to work.  Have tried passing waypoints and
  absolute cells as parameters, but nothing works.  This is not used in
  any of the original Red Alert missions.

27    Global is set
-------------------
    The trigger is activated when the specified global value is in the
  'set' position.
    The second parameter holds the number of the global value to test
  against.

28    Global is clear
---------------------
    The trigger is activated when the specified global value is in the
  'clear' position.
    The second parameter holds the number of the global value to test
  against.

29    Destroyed, Fakes, All
---------------------------
    Cannot get it to work correctly - it always seems to be fired straight
  away.  This is not used by Westwood in their missions.

30    Low power
---------------
    This trigger is fired when the specified country is low on power.
    The country to test for low power is specified in the second
  parameter.

31    All bridges destroyed
---------------------------
    This trigger is fired when all of the bridges on the map have been
  destroyed.  Naturally, indestructible land bridges are not counted for
  this event, only those concrete bridges that can be damaged and
  destroyed.
    This event does not require any parameters.

32    Building exists
---------------------
    This trigger is fired if a particular building is currently on the
  map, for a particular country.
    The second parameter holds the building number (see Available Red
  Alert Buildings for this list).
    Part 2 of the trigger holds the country number.


[4-13-3]  Available Trigger Actions

 34      Add repeating special weapon
 35      Preferred target
 36      Launch nukes

There is no trigger action number 14.

Descriptions of how these trigger action work, and what they do follows:

0     No action
---------------
    No action is associated with this trigger.  This is usually used when
  you don't want a secondary trigger.

1     Winner is
---------------
    The associated country wins the mission.  If this country is not the 
  player's country, then the player will lose if this trigger is fired.
    The third parameter holds the country number.

2     Loser is
--------------
    The associated country loses the mission.  If this country is not the
  player's country, then the player will win the mission if this
  trigger is fired.  However, this also causes the game to crash (at least
  in some cases).  Only associate the player's country with this action.
    The third parameter holds the country number.

3     Production begins
-----------------------
    The specified country is able to start production of units and
  buildings.  If the country does not have production turned on, it cannot
  create anything, even if another trigger tells it to.  Production cannot
  be turned off once it has been turned on.  At the beginning of each
  mission, production is turned off.  Even if "auto-base building" has
  been triggered, the country still needs a production trigger before it
  can begin producing anything.
    The third parameter takes the number of the country.

4     Create team
-----------------
    When activated, the country owning the specified teamtype will attempt
  to make the specified teamtype.  If it does not have the required
  buildings (war factory/barracks) or the requisite units on the map,
  this construction will fail.  The computer player is not required to have
  the prerequisite buildings that the human player must have (i.e. it can 
  build mammoth tanks without having a service depot), nor is it limited to 
  what that country would normally be able to build.  The USSR could build
  light tanks and mobile gap generators if the teamtype called for it, as 
  England could produce mammoth tanks.
    When creating a team, the computer country will first look around
  the map to see if there is currently a unit on the map of the specified
  type that is not currently in a teamtype and not engaged in a non-
  recruitable activity.  If there is such a unit, it will be used as part of 
  the team being created. 
    The computer will always build additional units after it has created
  the teamtype.  
    Note that computer players with high IQ levels will automatically
  create units for themselves that are not specified in teamtypes, nor
  which are called to be produced by Create Team commands. 
    The first parameter takes the number of the teamtype that is to be
  created.

5     Destroy team
------------------
    When activated, the specified teamtype is destroyed, logically.  This
  means that the units in the specified teamtype no longer perform the
  actions of the teamtype, and the computer can use them when creating
  new teamtypes.  The units in the team will complete the action they were
  engaged in when destroyed, and once that action has been completed will
  just stay where they were located when the teamtype was destroyed,
  presumably in guard mode.  All the instances of a particular teamtype
  will be destroyed when this trigger action is fired.
    The first parameter takes the number of the teamtype to destroy.
  Remember, the numbering of teamtypes starts at zero.

6     All to hunt
-----------------
    When this trigger action is fired, all of the units of the specified
  country are set to the action Hunt.  This causes those units to seek out
  their enemies and destroy them.
    The third parameter holds the country number that should be set to
  hunt.

7     Reinforcement (team)
--------------------------
    This brings in the specified teamtype to the specified waypoint. 
    The first parameter holds the teamtype to be used as the
  reinforcements.  Remember, the first occurrence in the [teamtype]
  section is numbered 0, not numbered 1.
    If the teamtype includes a transport helicopter (probably also an APC
  or LST), then you can specify the waypoint at which to drop them off by
  using the third parameter.
    See the section 'How to get units appearing out of buildings' on how
  to do as the title suggests. 

8     Drop zone flare (waypoint)
--------------------------------
    This drops a green flare at the specified waypoint, and reveals a
  small section of the map around that point.  The area revealed is
  smaller than that revealed by trigger event 17.
    The third parameter takes the waypoint at which to drop the flare.

9     Fire sale
---------------
    This has the associated country sell off all of their structures.  It
  takes as its third parameter the country number that is to sell off
  its buildings.
    Please note that it is possible to have the player's buildings sold in
  this way.
    It is only the third parameter that determines which country sells
  their buildings, part 2 of the trigger has no effect.

10    Play movie
----------------
    This has Red Alert play the specified movie as soon as the trigger is
  activated.  Be aware that sounds from the mission can persist into the
  first few moments of the movie, as they are not stopped (so if you get
  reinforcements and play a movie because of it, the "Reinforcements have
  arrived" sound will persist into the start of the movie).
    See Available Red Alert Movies for the complete listing of movies
  available.
    The number of the movie to be shown is stored in the third parameter.
  If the third parameter holds a movie number that does not exist on the
  cdrom that is currently in the drive, then all that will happen is that
  the screen will quickly flash to black, and return normally.

11    Text trigger (ID number)
------------------------------
    Displays a short text message in the upper left corner of the screen.
  The text itself is stored in the tutorial.ini file (see Tutorial.ini).
    The third parameter holds the text ID number.

12    Destroy trigger
---------------------
    The specified trigger is destroyed.  This is especially useful if you
  want to have a trigger repeat until some action occurs that will halt
  that trigger.
    The second parameter holds the number of the trigger to destroy
  (remember, trigger numbering starts from 0).

13    Autocreate begins
-----------------------
    The specified country has its autocreation ability turned on.  The use
  of autocreate is tricky, and is controlled through the various teamtypes
  used. 
    The third parameter takes the number of the country for which to turn
  on autocreation.

15    Allow win
---------------
     Similar to global variables.  Used when you want a specific objective
  to be met before the mission is accomplished.  In other words, if the
  trigger with this action assigned to it hasn't been fired, but the
  actual WIN trigger has been fired, the mission will not end until this
  "allow win" trigger is fired.
    The third parameter takes the country number that must meet this win
  condition.  On further examination, it may be that this does not take
  any parameters at all (ie the parameters can all be set to -1). 
  However, I am unsure of this.

16    Reveal all map
--------------------
    Reveals the entire map when the trigger is fired.
    It takes no parameters.

17    Reveal around waypoint
----------------------------
    Reveals the area around the specified waypoint.  The area revealed
  around the specified waypoint seems to be quite large.
   The third parameter holds the waypoint.

18    Reveal zone of waypoint
-----------------------------
    Reveals the area that is considered to be the "zone" of the specified
  waypoint.  See "What is the Zone of a cell?" for a discussion on what
  makes up the "zone". 
    The third parameter holds the waypoint.

19    Play sound effect
-----------------------
    Plays the specified sound effect.  See "Available Red Alert Sound
  Effects" for a listing of the available sound effects.
    The third parameter holds the sound effect number.

20    Play music theme
----------------------
    When this trigger is fired, the specified piece of music is played.
  See Available Red Alert Songs for the list of song numbers that you want
  to play.
    The third parameter holds the song number to play.  This only seems
  to work when there is no other music currently playing.

21    Play speech
-----------------
    Plays the specified piece of speech.  See Available Red Alert Speeches
  for a listing of the available speeches.
    The third parameter holds the speech number.

22    Force trigger
-------------------
    The specified trigger is fired.  The trigger that is pointed to
  usually has both trigger events set to 0 (no event) so that it cannot
  otherwise be triggered, but this does not have to be the case.
    The second parameter holds the trigger number.  Remember, the first
  trigger in the [Trigs] section is number 0, the second number 1, etc.
    A destroyed trigger may still be forced.

23    Timer start
-----------------
    The global mission timer is started (the timer is shown).
    It takes no parameters (set them to -1).

24    Timer stop
----------------
    The global mission timer is stopped (the timer is no longer shown).
    It takes no parameters (set them to -1).

25    Timer extend (1/10th min)
-------------------------------
    The global mission timer has its duration extended by the specified
  duration.  The duration specified is in tenths of a minute (i.e. 60 
  would extend the timer by 1 minute, etc).
    The third parameter takes the duration to add to the global mission
  timer.

26    Timer shorten (1/10th min)
--------------------------------
    The global mission timer has its duration decreased by the specified
  duration.  The duration specified is in tenths of a minute (i.e. 600 
  would shorten the timer by 10 minutes, etc).
    The third parameter takes the time to remove from the global mission
  timer.

27    Timer set (1/10th min)
----------------------------
    This sets the global timer to the specified time, and begins the
  count-down immediately.
    The third parameter takes the time to set it to, in tenths of a
  minute, eg 60 will set the timer to 6 minutes, 600 to 60 minutes, etc.

28    Global set
----------------
    The specified global value is placed in the 'set' position.
    The third parameter takes the number of the global value to place in
  the 'set' position.

29    Global clear
------------------
    The specified global value is placed in the 'clear' position.
    The third parameter takes the number of the global value to place in
  the 'clear' position.

30    Auto base building
------------------------
    Having this as a trigger action essentially puts that computer player
  into 'skirmish' mode.  The computer player will begin to build any new
  buildings and units that it feels it ought to have.  Given a large
  enough supply of money, it will eventually build massive amounts of
  units and structures, the result of which is to bring the game to an
  incredibly slow level of play.  The computer player will not be
  limited to constructing structures specified in the [Base] section, nor
  building units contained in teamtypes.
    The third parameter holds the number of the country you want to put
  into this mode.

31    Grow shroud one 'step'
----------------------------
    The shroud is increased by one cell all around its border.  It takes
  no parameters (set them all to -1).

32    Destroy attached building
-------------------------------
    All buildings that have this trigger attached to them explode.  It
  takes no parameters (set them all to -1).

33    Add 1-time special weapon
-------------------------------
     This is used to give the specified country access to one of the
  special weapons, the list of which is available in the section Red Alert
  Special Weapons.
    Please note that the country still has to wait for the charge-up
  period to pass before they are able to use this special weapon.
    The third parameter is used to specify which of the special weapons to
  give the team.
    You specify which team gets this special weapon through part 2 of the
  trigger.

34    Add repeating special weapon
----------------------------------
    This seems not to work.  It brings up the sidebar as if it were adding
  something to it, but nothing new appears there.

35    Preferred target
----------------------
    Not fully tested, but it seems to decide what this country should be
  targeting from the passed parameter.  See Available Target Types for the
  numbering.
    The third parameter takes the number of the target type.
    I am unsure as to which parameter takes the country number, or even
  if the computer obeys this command.

36    Launch nukes
------------------
    Contrary to what you might think, this does not cause the computer
  players to launch A-Bombs, at least not in the way you would normally
  want.  When this trigger is fired, all Missile Silos on the map will
  open up and fire an A-Bomb (this includes those Missile Silos that are
  owned by the human).  When these A-Bombs are launched, you get the
  normal voice warning about this occuring, but the A-Bombs never land,
  and hence do no damage to anything.
    When this is action is activated, the A-Bombs will be launched without
  thought to whether the country owning the Missile Silo actually has
  waited the necessary time to construct the missile.  This means that you
  could, for example, have this happen every five seconds if you wanted to
  annoy the human palyer that much.  Having an A-bomb launched this way
  does not reset the countdown timer (at least for the human player).
    This action takes no parameters (set them all to -1).


[4-14]  [TeamTypes] Section
==========================
    Teamtypes are used to tell the computer player what units they should
  be building, and how they should be constructing those units.  Each
  teamtype contains a list of units and a list of commands to carry out,
  but also a number of variables, each of which alters the behaviour of
  that teamtype, whether it be how the teamtype is created, or how it
  behaves after it has been created.
    It is these additional behavioural modifiers that make it rather
  tricky to completely determine a teamtype's behaviour.

    An example of a [TeamType] entry is:
       satk2=2,1,15,0,1,-1,-1,2,E1:1,E2:1,4,16:13,0:8,0:2,0:1

    The form for [TeamType] entries is:
       tname=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,AA,9,BB

Each section of the teamtype entry is described below:

tname
-----
    This is just a name for the teamtype, so that you can know what they
  are.  It can be any combination of alphanumeric letters and symbols,
  except spaces.

1 (country)
-----------
    This holds the numeric value of the country that owns this teamtype.
  See Available Red Alert Countries for the list of country numbers.

2 (teamtype characteristics)
----------------------------
    The 2nd teamtype number determines five different team
  characteristics.  It is the decimal equivalent of a five digit binary
  sequence: ABCDE.
   A = destroyed members of this team are replaced
   B = an inactive duplicate of this team is produced
   C = this is an autocreate team
   D = this team executes orders regardless of enemy actions
   E = this team takes evasive action

   In all cases 1 = yes, 0 = no
  
   E.g.: yes,no,yes,no,yes = 10101 = 
       2^4*1 + 2^3*0 + 2^2*1 +2^1*0 + 2^0*1 =
       16 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 21  

    A team taking evasive action will avoid, where possible, enemy radii
  of visiblity or guard.  A team executing orders regardless of enemy
  action will not stop to engage in fire-fights with enemy units, though
  it may let off some pot-shots en route.

    Here is the full table of available values that this teamtype number
  can validly contain.  You use the middle number in the teamtype entry. 
  The third column contains the various characteristics this teamtype will
  possess, using the five values above.

   Raw Value   Number  Characteristics
   -----------------------------------
    00000        0      (nothing special)
    00001        1      E
    00010        2      D
    00011        3      D+E
    00100        4      C
    00101        5      C+E
    00110        6      C+D
    00111        7      C+D+E
    01000        8      B
    01001        9      B+E
    01010       10      B+D
    01011       11      B+D+E
    01100       12      B+C
    01101       13      B+C+E
    01110       14      B+C+D
    01111       15      B+C+D+E
    10000       16      A
    10001       17      A+E
    10010       18      A+D
    10011       19      A+D+E
    10100       20      A+C
    10101       21      A+C+E
    10110       22      A+C+D
    10111       23      A+C+D+E
    11000       24      A+B
    11001       25      A+B+E
    11010       26      A+B+D
    11011       27      A+B+D+E
    11100       28      A+B+C
    11101       29      A+B+C+E
    11110       30      A+B+C+D
    11111       31      A+B+C+D+E

3 (unknown)
-----------
    The influence of this number is not apparent.  Westwood almost
  invariably uses "7" for a reinforcement from off map, "10" for a
  reinforcement from on map.  Other patterns are discernible, but no
  difference in results has ever been observed by setting this number at
  random.

4 (unknown)
-----------
    Westwood uses "0", and very rarely "1" or "2".  Again, it's influence
  is not known outside of WWS.
 
5 (maximum number of instances of the teamtype)
-----------------------------------------------
    If the team is an autocreate type as specified by the second number,
  this is the maximum number of instances of this team that may exist
  concurrently.

    If the team is not of the autocreate type, this functions as a trigger
  to make the team.  Still, it denotes the same maximum.

6 (waypoint for team appearance)
--------------------------------
    If you are using this team in a Reinforcement trigger, then this holds
  the waypoint at which you want the team to appear.  You must make sure
  that the waypoint you specify here is included in the [Waypoints]
  section, otherwise Red Alert will crash (badly).
    Set this to -1 if you are not going to use it.

7 (trigger to attach)
---------------------
    This value holds the trigger that you want to attach to the teamtype.
  If you do not wish to attach a trigger to the teamtype, set this number
  to -1.  Remember, numbering of triggers starts at 0.
    This is useful when you want an action to occur when a teamtype is
  attacked or destroyed, for example, although more complicated manoeuvers
  are possible.

8 (how many different unit types there are)
-------------------------------------------
    This number tells the parser how many different types of units to
  expect in this TeamType entry (in section AA).

AA (list of units in the team)
------------------------------
    This is a comma-delimited list of the units that will make up this
  team.  There must be as many entries in this list as was specified in
  part 8 of the TeamType.  Each entry in this list has the form X:Y where
  X is the abbreviated version of the unit, and Y is the number of units
  of that type.
    For the abbreviations of the units, see sections: Available Red Alert
  Vehicles, Available Red Alert Infantry, Available Red Alert Aircraft,
  and Available Red Alert Ships.
    Each team can be made up of a collection of infantry, vehicles,
  aircraft and ships.  Trucks will not combine with other types in a team.

9 (how many commands this team has)
-----------------------------------
    This number tells the parser how many commands this team is being
  assigned (in section BB).

BB (list of commands to the team)
---------------------------------
    This is a comma-delimited list of the actions that this team will be
  asked to perform.  There must be as many entries in this list as was
  specified in part 9 of the TeamType.  Each entry in this list has the
  form X:Y, where X is the number of the action to perform, and Y is the
  value passed to this action.
    For the available actions that can be performed by the team, see
  the section Available Team Actions.  This will also tell you what form
  the Y value must take.


[4-14-1]  Available TeamType Actions
====================================
    These are the available actions that teams in the [TeamTypes] section
  can perform:

 #'s  Short Description
 ----------------------
  0    Attack
  1    Attack Waypoint
  2    Change Formation to
  3    Move to waypoint
  4    Move to cell
  5    Guard area (1/10th min)
  6    Jump to line #
  7    Attack Tarcom
  8    Unload
  9    Deploy
 10    Follow friendlies
 11    Do this
 12    Set global
 13    Invulnerable
 14    Load onto transport
 15    Spy on building @ waypoint
 16    Patrol to waypoint

These are discussed in more detail now:

0    Attack
-----------
    This determines what you want the teamtype to attack.  See Available
  Target Types for the various types of targets that you can give a
  teamtype.

1    Attack Waypoint
--------------------
    The units in the team will go and attack the specified waypoint.  If
  the unit has the Infiltrate ability, then it will attempt to enter the
  building.  This will happen even if the country owning the units in this
  teamtype owns the building at the waypoint.
    If the unit has the C4 ability, it will blow up the building at the
  specified waypoint.
    The value passed to this action is the waypoint at which you want the
  teamtype to attack.
    If there is no building at the specified waypoint, the teamtype will
  not activate correctly (usually they will just sit in their last
  position).

2    Change Formation to
------------------------
    When given this command, the units in this teamtype will attempt to
  change formations to the one specified.  See Available Unit Formations
  for the listing of formations and their appropriate numbering.

3    Move to waypoint
---------------------
    The units in the team are to move towards the specified waypoint. 
    The value passed to this action is the waypoint to which the team
  is to move.

4    Move to cell
-----------------
    The units in the teamtype will move towards the specified cell.  Why
  you would want to use this over Move to waypoint beats me, but I would
  guess that there are some occasions where you may want to specify an
  absolute cell.
    The value passed to this action is the cell to which the teamtype is
  to move towards.

5    Guard area (1/10th min)
----------------------------
    The units in the team will stay where they are and be on the look-out
  for enemy units that come near them.  If an enemy unit comes into their
  guard range, they will go and intercept the enemy.
    The value passed to this action is the number of time units you want
  them to be on guard for (in steps of one tenth of a minute).

6    Jump to line #
-------------------
    You use this to get repeating actions for the teamtype.  The parameter
  passed is the action number of the teamtype that you want to jump to.
  The first action of a teamtype is numbered 0, the second 1, etc.  If you
  jump to number 0, you get the teamtype repeating all the commands it
  has, looping forever (good for setting up patrol routes).  You don't
  have to repeat all the action, of course, you could, for example, skip
  to action number 2, which would ignore the first two action commands,
  and just go from the third.

7    Attack Tarcom
------------------
     Team moves to top left of map and fires at an off-screen target.

8    Unload
-----------
    If the team contains units that are currently being stored in a
  transport of some type (TRAN, APC, LST etc), then passing the team
  this command will make the units inside the transport disembark.
    It is not passed a value, so set that to 0.
    If the teamtype contains a minelayer, the unload command will cause
  the minelayer to lay down a mine at its current position.

9    Deploy
-----------
    If the unit in the team is an MCV, sending it this command will cause
  it to deploy itself into a construction yard at its present location.
    It is not passed a value, so set that to 0.

10   Follow friendlies
----------------------
    The unit(s) in this team will follow the nearest friendly unit 
  when that friendly unit starts to move.  This following doesn't appear
  to be permanent.
    It is not passed a value, so set that to 0.

11   Do this
------------
    The units in the team will perform the following actions.  Not all of
  these work, and some are made obsolete by other teamtype action
  commands.  They are actually the same commands as a units can be given
  when being placed on the map.  See Available Initial Unit Commands for
  the listing of the numbering of the possible values you can use here.

12   Set global
---------------
    The specified global variable is placed into the 'set' position.  Pass
  this command the number of the global variable that you wish to set.

13   Invulnerable
-----------------
    The units in this teamtype have the Iron Curtain cast on them.  
  It does not matter whether there is one unit or five units in the
  teamtype; all will have the Iron Curtain cast on them (normal rules
  about what can be IC'd still apply).
    This means that the side does not have to wait for the Iron Curtain to
  recharge like the player must.
    It is not passed a value, so set that to 0.

14   Load onto transport
------------------------
    If there is a transport unit (such as an APC etc), then infantry
  units in this teamtype will attempt to load onto that transport.  The
  infantry units travel to the transport unit, not the other way around.
    If the transport unit is something like an LST, then vehicles will do
  the same thing (travel to the transport and load).
    It is not passed a value, so set that to 0.
    I have not been able to get a teamtype to load onto a transport,
  unload somewhere, and then load again.  If the teamtype was given a Move
  command after the teamtype unloaded, only the transport moved, which
  suggests that the infantry units (or vehicle units for an LST) are no
  longer considered to be part of the same teamtype.

15   Spy on building @ waypoint
-------------------------------

16   Patrol to waypoint
-----------------------
    Similar to Move to waypoint, it takes as its parameter the waypoint to
  patrol to.  It differs from the Move command in that the units in the 
  teamtype will move out of their patrol route to actively go and engage
  enemy units and buildings that are within their patrol range as they
  move to the waypoint.
    WARNING: Having the teamtype patrol to a waypoint takes up
  considerable processing power, as it scans for enemy units with each
  step it takes.  If you have more than 1 or 2 teamtypes doing this action
  at the same time, it will introduce some jerkiness to Red Alert (on a
  P166).  If you have a lot of teamtypes performing patrols to waypoint at
  the same time, Red Alert will crawl.


[4-15]  [MapPack] Section
=========================
    This section of the ini file contains the information about the full
  map for your mission.  It is encoded in base64, but as the terrain
  editor created this section for you, there is not that much to know.
    The encoding method for the [MapPack] section has been cracked.  Take
  a look at the Internet Resources for a site that carries information on
  how to decode this section after the base64 decryption.


[4-16]  [OverlayPack] Section
=============================
    Overlays are those sections of the map that are placed on top of the
  map, such as gold and gems and walls.  I assume that it is also encoded
  in base 64.  The terrain editor takes care of this section as well.
    The encoding method for the [OverlayPack] section has been cracked. 
  Take a look at the Internet Resources for a site that carries
  information on how to decode this section after the base64 decryption.


[4-17]  [Digest] Section
========================
    This appears to be some form of checksum for the file when it is saved
  in the terrain editor.  If you edit a file with a [Digest] section, then
  Red Alert will pop up an error saying the scenario may be corrupt, but
  otherwise behave normally.  It is best to delete the [Digest] section.


[4-18]  [Briefing] Section
==========================
    You can use the [Briefing] section in a mission's .ini file to specify
  the briefing you want for that mission by putting any sort of
  mission.ini file into the Red Alert directory.  However, the mission.ini
  entry will take precedence over that in the [Briefing] section.
    Using this method is much easier than using the mission.ini file
  method, as anyone playing a new mission just needs a blank mission.ini
  file in the directory.  This blank file will override all the scXXXeX
  mission briefings, and the new missions can then get the briefings from
  within their own .ini files instead, by using the [Briefing] section. 
    The format of this section is the same as a mission.ini entry.
      eg.  [Briefing]
           1=Your Briefing Goes Here
           2=Etc Etc @@ Good Luck


[4-19]  [Overlay] Section
=========================
    Instead of storing the map overlays in the [OverlayPack] section,
  setting the NewINIFormat variable in the [Basic] section to the correct
  variable allows the use of the [Overlay] section.  It is formatted like
  the original C&C [Overlay] section.

    This section will not be explained in this document due to the
  presence of the [OverlayPack] section.  If a map editor is released that
  requires this section be explained, then this section will be revised.

Counterstrike only:
ANTEND      99   *counterstrike only*  Queen ant dying in fire - ant end
                                         movie.
ANTINTRO   100   *counterstrike only*  "It came from Red Alert" - ant
                                         intro movie.

    There are 3 videos that are on neither cdrom: SNOWBASE, SHIPYARD, and 
  ENGLISH.
    SNOWBASE and SHIPYARD perform as other videos do when the wrong cdrom
  is in the driver, but ENGLISH causes Red Alert to crash (at least the
  Windows 95 version) when played from the Soviet cdrom (at least from
  the Play Movie trigger).
    It is likely for foreign language versions of Red Alert that the
  ENGLISH video will have some other name.

    When a movie is specified with the Play Movie trigger and it does not
  exist on the cdrom that is currently in the drive, there will be a brief
  flash of black (if black can be considered to be a 'flashable' colour),
  then the mission will resume.  The exception is the ENGLISH movie, which
  crashes on the Soviet disk.  Do not specify a movie name/number that is
  not on the current disk.

Counterstrike only:
 84    QUEE   Queen ant structure
 85    LAR1   Ant - single ant larva
 86    LAR2   Ant - two ant larvae

    While MINV and MINP do cause the trigger to be activated if they are
  made buildable, placing a bought mine causes the construction yard to
  go berserk and stops the further placement of any other buildings. 
    Those structures that have an 'x' where their number should be do not
  activate the Build Building type trigger.
    Any structure without an icon that is made buildable will get a
  'hall-of-mirrors' icon when displayed.  This means that their icon will
  be made up of bits of graphics from whatever was last displayed in
  that section of the screen.
    The civilian structures marked with a * (V20 to V37) do not have any
  graphics displayed on either the SNOW or TEMPERATE theatres.  In the
  original Command and Conquer, they appeared only in the DESERT theatre,
  which was not included in Red Alert.  They are a left-over from C&C.
    The civilian structure V20 and V24 not only have no description
  associated with them, but they also are not selectable.
    The two types of barrel and mines are not selectable.

    After some digging around, I have determined that the statement that
  the V20 to V37 structures are left-overs from C&C days is not quite
  true.  It is true that they have no graphics, but there is a way of
  providing your own graphics for them (see Section [7-14]  Advanced
  Editing: Just how extensible is Red Alert?) for more on this.


[5-7]  Available Red Alert Infantry Units
=========================================
    The following infantry units are in Red Alert (note that the attack
  dog is treated as an infantry unit by Red Alert):

 #'s  Abbrev.       Name              Has Icon

 22    DELPHI      Special 1            No
 23    CHAN        Special 2            No

    The names of the civilian units are not normally visible, but can be
  made visible be setting the NamedCivilians variable to yes in the
  [General] section of the rules.ini file (or see the section Changing
  Red Alert Values on how to do this for an individual mission).


[5-8]  Available Red Alert Vehicles
===================================
    The following vehicles are available in Red Alert (please note that
  ships are not counted as vehicles):

 #'s  Abbrev.   Name                        Has Icon
 ---------------------------------------------------
  0    4TNK    Mammoth Tank                   Yes
  1    3TNK    Heavy Tank                     Yes
  2    2TNK    Medium Tank                    Yes
  3    1TNK    Light Tank                     Yes
  4    APC     Armoured Personnel Carrier     Yes
  5    MNLY    Mine Layer                     Yes
  6    JEEP    Ranger                         Yes
  7    HARV    Ore Truck                      Yes
  8    ARTY    Artillery                      Yes
  9    MRJ     Mobile Radar Jammer            Yes

 11    MCV     Mobile Construction Vehicle    Yes
 12    2VRL    V2 Rocket Launcher             Yes
 13    TRUK    Convoy Truck                  *Yes*

 Counterstrike only:
 14    ANT1    First ant type                 No
 15    ANT2    Second ant type                No
 16    ANT3    Third ant type                 No

    The convoy truck does have an icon, but it looks nothing like the unit
  does in the game.  It looks like the ranger's icon, except the rear part
  of the ranger is exploding.  This is only in the MS-DOS version of Red
  Alert.  The Window 95 version of Red Alert has a correct icon (the unit
  on the icon actually looks like the convoy truck).


[5-9]  Available Red Alert Aircraft
=================================
    The following aircraft are available in Red Alert:

 #'s  Abbrev.   Names              Has Icon
 ------------------------------------------
 0     TRAN    Chinook Helicopter    Yes
 1     BADR    Badger Bomber         Yes
 2     U2      Spy Plane             Yes
 3     MIG     MIG Attack Plane      Yes
 4     YAK     Yak Attack Plane      Yes
 5     HELI    Longbow Helicopter    Yes
 6     HIND    Hind Helicopter       Yes

    The Badger Bomber and Spy Planes, if made buyable by the player,
  cannot be selected and hence cannot be moved off the airfield.


[5-10]  Available Red Alert Ships
=================================
    The following ships are available in Red Alert (they don't have any
  numbers because they cannot be used in triggers):

 Abbrev.   Names                   Has Icon
 ------------------------------------------
   SS     Submarine                  Yes
   DD     Destroyer                  Yes
   CA     Cruiser                    Yes
   LST    Land-Sea Tank (transport)  Yes
   PT     Gun Boat                   Yes


[5-11]  Available Unit Formations
=================================
 
    These appear to be the formations that teamtypes can form:

 #'s  Formation      Description
 -------------------------------
  0    None           ?
  1    Tight          Very close grouping, slower units manage to keep up
                      with the faster ones.
  2    Loose          Doesn't do much.
  3    Wedge North    }
  4    Wedge East     } See note below
  5    Wedge South    }
  6    Wedge West     }
  7    Line N/S       Causes the units to spread out in a vertical line
                      and perform its next command (in that form unless an
                      obstacle breaks it).
  8    Line E/W       The same as above, except it is a horizontal line.
  9    North          ?
 10    East           ?
 11    South          ?
 12    West           ?
 13    Air            ?

    The Tight formation seems only to work with five infantry units - any
  more and it stops.
    Note about Wedge: The units will fan out and make a cone shape. The
  'point' of the cone faces in the direction specified.  However, once
  they form this formation the team seems to stay in that position, or at
  most move to the next waypoint and then stop.  I believe that this
  formation is meant for guarding large areas of space, or it is just
  plain buggy.  The units will line up from the point and form two
  diagonal lines.

    Additional note: to get the formations to work, you need to set them
  *before* doing the move command.  So, you would use something like
  2:3,3:21 to get a North Wedge at waypoint 21.  As noted above, however,
  it seems as though all actions following the next move command are 
  ignored.


[5-12]  Available Red Alert Special Weapons
===========================================
    These are the special weapons that are available in Red Alert that can
  be delivered through the use of a 1-time special weapon trigger action.

 #'s      Name
 -------------
  0      Sonar Pulse
  1      Nuclear Strike
  2      Chrono-shift
  3      Parabomb
  4      Paratroopers
  5      Spy Plane
  6      Iron Curtain
  7     **GPS**

    A note on the GPS.  While the icon appears as normal and it eventually
  becomes active, the satellite will not automatically launch as it does
  when the Allied tech. centre is built.  If the icon is clicked upon, the
  voice will say "Select target", but the cursor does not change into a
  target cursor, and hence clicking on the map does not release the
  satellite.


[5-13]  Available Initial Unit Commands
=====================================
    Each unit that appears on the map at the beginning of a mission has an
  associated starting command.  This command tells the unit what to do in
  the time before it is given any orders by either the human player or
  a computer player.  The available commands are:

 #'s    Command
 --------------
  0     Sleep
  1     Attack
  2     Move
  3     Qmove
  4     Retreat 
  5     Guard
  6     Sticky
  7     Enter
  8     Capture 
  9     Harvest
 10     Area Guard
 11     Return (unused)
 12     Stop
 13     Ambush (unused)
 14     Hunt
 15     Unload
 16     Sabotage
 17     Construction
 18     Selling
 19     Repair
 20     Rescue
 21     Missile
 22     Harmless

    Numbers 17, 18, 19 and 21 are undertaken by buildings only.
    Not all of these commands actually have the unit/building do anything,
  just like the original C&C. 
    The difference between Guard and Area Guard is that, in Area Guard,
  the unit is much more vigorous in defending the area around it, and will
  follow any units that come into its defending area.  The following
  behaviour lasts until it can attack its prey, whereupon the unit will
  return to its original position (unless it caught up with the prey
  within its initial guard zone, when it will attempt to destroy the
  invader).  

    Also, units in Area Guard mode seem not to be gathered from
  the field when a Create Team command is issued.  Those in Guard mode
  will be gathered to create the new team (if they are required, of
  course).


[5-14]  Available Terrain Types
===============================
    The following are the valid terrain features:

  MINE           ---} gold mine
  BOXES01   ---}
  BOXES02      } groups
  BOXES03      }   of
  BOXES04      } boxes
  BOXES05   ---}
  ICE01          ---}
  ICE02             }
  ICE03             }  ice
  ICE04             } flows
  ICE05          ---}
  T01       ---}
  T02          }
  T03          }
  T04          }
  T05          } 
  T07          } 
  T07          } single
  T08          } trees
  T09          }
  T10          }
  T11          }
  T12          }
  T13          }
  T14          }
  T15          }
  T16          }
  T17       ---}
  TC01           ---}
  TC02              } clumps
  TC03              }   of
  TC04              } trees
  TC05           ---}

    The terrain type MINE is the goldmine that is used to stimulate ore 
  regrowth.
    The terrain types T01 to T17 are single trees.
    The terrain types TC01 to TC05 are clumps of trees.
    The terrain types ICE01 to ICE05 are ice floes.

    The ICE01 to ICE05 graphics are visible in the terrain editor, but
  cannot be placed in the terrain editor.  They have the following
  dimensions:
      ICE01   2x2
      ICE02   2x1 (2 cells high)
      ICE03   1x2 (2 cells wide)
      ICE04   1x1
      ICE05   1x1

    The terrain types BOXES01 to BOXES05 are various groups of boxes that
  are used in the interior missions.  Their graphics are only drawn when
  using the INTERIOR theater (they seem to be totally discarded in the
  other theaters, as the space where they are supposed to be can be walked
  over).


[5-15]  Available Smudge Types
==============================
    The following are the available smudge types:

  CR1          ---}
  CR2             }
  CR3             } craters
  CR4             }
  CR5             }
  CR6          ---}
  SC1     ---}
  SC2        }
  SC3        } scorch
  SC4        } marks
  SC5        }
  SC6     ---}
  BIB1         ---}
  BIB2            }  dirt
  BIB3         ---} patches

    The smudge effects CR1 to CR6 are various types of small craters.
    The smudge effects SC1 to SC6 are various types of scorch marks.
    The smudge effects BIB1 to BIB3 are the patches of dirt that appear at
  the base of most buildings (the light coloured dirt).


[5-16]  Available Target Types
==============================
    These are the numbers that represent the various 'targets' in Red
  Alert.  The descriptions should be self-explanatory.

 #'s  Short Description
 ----------------------
  1    Anything
  2    Buildings - any
  3    Harvesters
  4    Infantry

CHAPTER [6]  Miscellaneous
--------------------------

[6-1]  Tutorial.ini
===================
    All of the short text pieces that are displayed during Red Alert
  missions are stored in a text file called tutorial.ini.  This file is
  part of the main.mix file, but if you put a tutorial.ini file in your
  Red Alert directory, it will override the one in the redalert.mix file.
    You can change the text of the entries already present without any 
  trouble. Keep the text that you want to display to a length of less than
  that is specified in the file (41 characters).
    The text number is placed in the third parameter of the trigger
  actions.
    You are able to include additional entries in the tutorial.ini file
  of your own, you do not have to stick to the 65 entries in the original
  tutorial.ini file.  To add new entries is simple, just put in the new
  lines of your own, for example:
    66=Wow, a new line of text
    67=Yet another home-grown message

[6-2]  Mission.ini
==================
    Each mission in Red Alert contains a brief text description of the
  objective of the mission.  These text descriptions are stored in a file
  called mission.ini, which is stored in the main.mix file, but which can
  be overridden if you place a file called mission.ini into your Red Alert
  directory.
    If you place a mission.ini file into your Red Alert directory, Red
  Alert will use the mission briefings from this file rather than the
  default ones found in the main.mix file.
    If you are using the SkipMapSelect to add extra missions into the
  original mission structure, then you can include the new missions'
  briefings by adding sections into the mission.ini file.  For example,
  say you added a second level 1 Soviet mission (scu01eb) through the
  use of SkipMapSelect.  To get a briefing, you would add a [SCU01EB]
  section to the mission.ini file and fill in the appropriate message.
    I do not know the exact maximum length an entry can be.
    You may notice the occurence of @'s in some of the briefings.  These
  are used to have the next bit of text start on the next line.  It
  appears to be the only piece of formatting available in the briefings
  (@ is shift-2).  Two @'s in a row will produce a blank line between two

    You do not have to include entries for all the missions in your

    WARNING: if you use SkipMapSelect to add a new mission to the original
  mission structure, you should make sure that the user understands the
  following: if the user takes a savegame of the additional mission and
  tries to restart it after they have removed your .ini file, Red Alert
  will give the error "Unable to read scenario", and crash.  If you are
  putting in additional missions using SkipMapSelect, make sure the user
  understands that, once they have gotten rid of your missions, that they
  will only be able to load that savegame, not restart it.



======================
-SECTION THREE- THEORY
======================

-----------------------------
CHAPTER [7]  From The Lectern
-----------------------------

    'From the Lectern' is a section intended to bring you some theory
  about how to use aspects of Red Alert that may not, at first glance,
  appear obvious to the reader.  These are not meant to be step-by-step
  guides in what you do to have your mission perform action X, but rather
  to introduce your mind to some concepts that utilise the knowledge of
  this guide in forms that go beyond the simplistic creation of units and
  firing of triggers.  At least, that is the hope.

[7-1]  Contributing to the Lectern
==================================
    If you wish to contribute to 'From the Lectern', please email one of
  the authors, at either "andrewg@light.iinet.net.au" or "cfhark@msn.com"
  with the subject of 'For the Lectern'.  Include both a short description
  of what you are going to describe so that we can determine whether to
  include it or not, and also the spell-checked text of your 'From the
  Lectern' entry.

    Try to be as detailed as possible in your submissions.  If you need to
  refer to parts of external files such as the rules.ini file or a .mpr or
  .ini file, do not include all of it.  Just include those parts that are
  directly referenced in your article.  Articles that include massive
  amounts of superfluous material will be subject to editing.


[7-2]  How to get units appearing out of buildings
==================================================
    You may have noticed that in some original Red Alert missions, that
  units would run out of buildings.  Here is the method to do just that.
  If you are using transports to bring units onto the battlefield as
  reinforcements, the usual reinforcements trigger looks something like:
      blah,7,5,-1,20,blah
  where 5 is the teamtype being reinforced, and 20 is the waypoint where
  they are going to be dropped off.
    However, if you want the units to appear from buildings, then your
  trigger would look like this:
      blah,7,5,-1,-1,blah
    Now all you have to do is to make two further changes, both of which
  are very easy.  The first is to make an entry in the [Waypoints] section
  of the cell in which you want the units to appear.  The second is to
  change the sixth teamtype value of this team to hold the new waypoint
  number.
    For example, if I wanted a team to appear at cell 8919, I might set
  waypoint 11=8919, so the sixth number in that teamtype would be 11.
    That's all, your team will now appear to be coming out of a building.

    I haven't managed to get the teamtype to appear out of nowhere; it
  seems as though the presence of the building at the spot you want them
  to appear from is a requirement.


[7-3]  Changing Red Alert Values
================================
    When you load up Red Alert, it can look in a file called 'rules.ini'
  to read in the values for just about everything in the game.  However,
  to make changes to these values by using the rules.ini file, you must
  restart Red Alert to get them to take effect.
    However, you can also place this information into your mission's ini
  file, and each time the mission is started, these values will be read
  from the mission's ini file and used.  Be aware, however, that the
  values you set in the mission's ini file do not carry over from one
  mission to the next.
    This is useful if you only want to make a few small changes, which you
  can just add in for a single mission, and have Red Alert revert to the
  original values for the other missions.  All you have to do is add the
  title of the section you want to change (eg [JEEP]), and then the
  sections that you want to be altered for this mission.
    For example, the following:
     [JEEP]
     Primary=FireballLauncher
  will make all jeeps in that particular mission be armed with the flame
  turret's weapon instead of the usual machine gun. 
    It seems as though you can include most of the sections in the
  rules.ini file in a mission's ini file without problems.  Be aware,
  however, that each time a mission in started or restarted, that the
  *entire* mission's ini file is read and decoded.  For this reason, you
  should only include those pieces of the rules.ini file that you want to
  change.  Don't do the following if you just want to change the jeep's
  weapon:
     [JEEP]
     Prerequisite=weap
     Primary=FireballLauncher
     Strength=150
     Armor=light
     TechLevel=3
     Sight=6
     Speed=10
     Owner=allies
     Cost=600
     Points=20
     ROT=10
     Crewed=yes
    While there is no noticeable change in the loading time of the
  mission if you include even the entire rules.ini file into your
  mission's ini file, trying to work out what you changed becomes
  impossible.  Feel free to include as much of the rules.ini as you want,
  but this is one case where I prefer the minimalist approach.

    NOTE: One variable that has no effect in a mission's ini file is the
  Image= variable.  This can only be set correctly in the rules.ini file. 
  So, if you want to change what a unit looks like through the use of the
  Image= variable, then you will have to supply a rules.ini file to set
  this.  Setting the Image= variable in a mission's ini file does nothing.


[7-4]  How to control where reinforcements come from
====================================================
    You have already seen how to get reinforcement teamtypes appearing
  from buildings, now we will discuss how to control the direction from
  which teamtypes come from when you are reinforcing them from off
  screen.  If you simply set the waypoint at which the reinforcement is to
  appear as some location on the map (that is not covered by a building),
  then the teamtype will appear from the edge of the map that is closest
  to their destination.  However, if you want them to appear from some
  other section of the map edge, then you have to do a little bit more
  work. 
    The first thing you have to do is create a waypoint that is not on the
  mission map.  This waypoint should be in the row or column of cells that
  is immediately outside of the mission map (ie say the mission map
  started 34 cells from the left edge of the full map, the waypoint you
  will use will be in the 33rd column of the full map).  You can do this
  easily by changing the X or Y value in the [Map] section by 1, loading
  the map in the terrain editor, and determining the waypoint.  When you
  have determined the cell number that you want to use as a waypoint,
  change the X or Y value back to its original value, and enter your new
  waypoint.  This new waypoint will be where the reinforcements will be
  created, and from where they will make their way to their destination
  waypoint.


[7-5]  How to get units to enter buildings
==========================================
    A number of infantry units have the ability to enter buildings
  (thieves, engineers, Tanya etc), and these will enter buildings of their
  own accord when given the order to attack.  This allows them to enter
  buildings that the player (or computer player) builds, the positions of
  which you don't know at the time of creating the mission.  But what if
  you want something to happen to a particular building that exists on the
  map at the beginning of the mission (or the position of which you know
  because it will be built through the [Base] section)?
    To get unit to enter a specific building, you give them the Attack at
  waypoint command, specifying the waypoint that the anchor cell of the
  building is located.  If the infantry unit has the Infiltrate ability,
  it will attempt to infiltrate that building.  Be aware, however, that if
  the specified building is an enemy building and the unit sent to
  infiltrate it has a weapon, that it will use this weapon to attack the
  building, rather than try and enter it.
    You can, of course, have infantry units enter buildings that they
  already own.  This can be used to good effect to give the mission a more
  dynamic feeling, if you feel that such would be necessary.  You could,
  for example, give some civilian units the Infiltrate ability and have
  them walk in and out of buildings.
    Spies, of course, should be given the Spy at waypoint command rather
  than Attack at waypoint.


[7-6]  Discussion on IQ Levels
==============================
    Unlike the original C&C, Red Alert introduces some basic intelligence
  to the computer players.  This makes creating a computer opponent for a
  single player mission both easier and more difficult than creating one
  for C&C.  More difficult because in C&C you controlled every single
  aspect of the computer players.  You can achieve this level of control
  by setting the IQ level of the computer players to 0, but this means you
  aren't able to use some of the features that IQ levels provide. 
  However, if you give the computer player a high level of IQ, then it
  will begin to perform actions other than those that you are telling it
  to perform.  This lack of control makes fine tuning missions a
  challenge.  Setting a high IQ also means that you are able to get a
  mission off the ground quicker, but my own personal preference is to
  avoid doing this (although your view may differ).

    One of the good features of the rules.ini file (and the fact that you
  are able to include pieces of it in your mission's ini file) is that you
  are able to change what each of the IQ levels does.  Here is the
  original [IQ] entry in the rules.ini file, comments and all:

; ******* IQ setting for computer activity *******
; Each player (computer controlled or otherwise) is given an IQ rating that is used
; to control what the computer is allowed to automatically control. This is
; distinct from the difficulty setting. The higher the IQ setting, the more autonomous
; and intelligent the side will behave. Each ability is given a rating that
; indicates the IQ level (or above) that the ability will be granted. Because such
; abilities are automatically performed by the computer, giving a human controlled
; country a high IQ is not recommended. Otherwise the player's units will start to
; automatically "do their own thing"! A human controlled country is presumed to have
; an IQ rating of zero. A computer controlled country has an IQ of 1 or higher.
; When in skirmish mode or when multiplayer AIs are active, the computer IQ is set to
; the maximum.
[IQ]
MaxIQLevels=5      ; the maximum number of discrete IQ levels
SuperWeapons=4     ; super weapons are automatically fired by computer
Production=5       ; building/unit production is automatically controlled by computer
GuardArea=4        ; newly produced units start in guard area mode
RepairSell=1       ; allowed to choose repair or sell of damaged buildings
AutoCrush=2        ; automatically try to crush antogonists if possible
Scatter=3          ; will scatter from incoming threats [grenades and such]
ContentScan=4      ; will consider contents of transport when picking good target
Aircraft=4         ; automatically replace aircraft or helicopters
Harvester=2        ; automatically replace lost harvesters
SellBack=2         ; allowed to sell buildings

    As you can see, there are a number of items that you can use.  For me,
  the most useful seem to be the ones to automatically replace lost units.
  The Production variable I see as more a curse than a blessing, as you
  lose complete control over what the computer will produce - you may as
  well be playing a game of skirmish at that level.  Remember that you can
  change these values in your ini file, so you may want to, for example,
  change Aircraft to have an IQ level of 2.

    An area that high IQ levels may come in handy is when the computer
  player is given access to various 'super weapons'.  Instead of having to
  program a specific trigger to fire the weapon (eg. firing a nuclear
  missile), you would be able to supply them with enough intelligence to
  fire it at their own discretion.  Far be it from me to be cynical enough
  to suggest that this form of intelligence may take the form of firing
  the weapon as soon as it was available.


[7-7]  On the use of Badger Bombers
===================================
    There are two uses for Badger bombers: reinforcing infantry units via
  parachute drops, and to drop parachute bomblets.  Both of these uses
  will be discussed in this section.

    It does not appear that the ability to specify a waypoint in the 
  reinforcement trigger action is utilised when dealing with Badger
  bombers.  You can either leave it to Red Alert to determine from which
  direction the bomber will come from, or you can use part 6 of the
  teamtype to specify the waypoint at which you wish them to appear.
  Remember, this waypoint should be outside of the mission map.  This is
  not 100% perfect however, but the bomber will appear within one or two
  cells of the waypoint you  specified (once it comes onto the map).
    If you leave it up to Red Alert to determine where the bomber will
  come in from, then you can use the sixth part of the teamtype to
  determine where the bomber will drop its payload (whether it be infantry
  units or bomblets).  In this case, Red Alert will choose the edge
  closest to the drop point, and make a bee-line to its target.  If you do
  leave it up to Red Alert to determine where to come from, then you do
  not give the teamtype any actions.  So, your teamtype would look like:
      reinf=2,0,7,0,0,10,-1,2,E1:5,BADR:1,0
  (ie, the drop point will be waypoint 10, which is on the mission map;
  Red Alert is left to determine where the plane comes from).
    However, if you specify a waypoint off the mission map in the sixth
  part of the teamtype, then you need to give the teamtype a command, in
  this case, an Attack at waypoint command.  Thus, your teamtype would
  look like:
      reinf=2,0,7,0,0,10,-1,2,E1:5,BADR:1,1,1:20
  (ie. the drop point will be waypoint 20, and the bomber should come from
  waypoint 10, which is off the mission map).
    Unfortunately, the Move to waypoint and Move to cell commands do not
  work, for as soon as the bomber gets to the specified cell, it begins a
  continual circling of that cell.

    Now that you know how to control where the bomber will come from, and
  where it will drop its payload, we will discuss the types of payload a
  bomber can carry.  These payloads are infantry units and bomblets. 
    Infantry are dealt with in the ordinary way.  You can have as many 
  different types of infantry units in a single bomber as you want, for
  example, 6,E1:1,E2:1,E3:1,E7:1,C1:5,BADR:1 would be perfectly
  acceptable.  When dealing with sending in infantry reinforcements, there
  doesn't seem to be a limit to the number of infantry units you can place
  within a single bomber.
    The infantry units will be dropped at the waypoint determined by one
  of the methods shown above.

    To get a bomber to drop bomblets rather than infantry, all you have to
  do is not give the bomber any payload.  This means that the relevant
  part of the teamtype will look like this: 1,BADR:1.  In this case, the
  bomber will drop its payload of bomblets at the specified waypoint.

    You can also get multiple bombers coming in just as easily as a single
  bomber, but there is something you must be careful of when doing this
  with infantry reinforcements.
    When the bombers will just be dropping bomblets, nothing extra needs
  to be done.  All you need to do is to change the teamtype so that
  instead of one Badger bomber being brought in, multiple are.  Thus, the
  relevant section of the teamtype would look like: 1,BADR:5 (to bring in
  5 Badger bombers). 
    However, if you want to use multiple bombers in a teamtype that will
  be dropping infantry units, you will have to be careful.  This is
  because only one bomber will drop infantry.  The rest will drop the
  bomblets.  They will do this at the same time, which usually results in
  the immediate death of the infantry units.  I have noticed, however,
  that if the target cell of bombers is occupied by a building, that the
  bombers carrying bombs will drop their load, but the infantry carrying
  bomber will not.  If the building gets destroyed by the rain of
  bomblets, then the infantry carrier will loop back and drop the infantry
  where the building was previously situated.  Thus, if the teamtype had
  the section: 2,E1:5,BADR:4, then one Badger bomber would carry the five
  infantry units, whilst the other three would carry the bomblets.


[7-8]  The Global Mission Timer
===============================
    When the timer has been stopped, using either timer extend or timer
  shorten will start the timer again.  If the use of timer shorten causes
  the timer to expire, then any trigger associated with the timer expires
  trigger event will be fired.

    The timer warnings are given automatically (ie. it will warn you at
  40 minutes, 30 minutes, 20 mintues etc), so there is no reason for you
  to add a play speech trigger to play these warnings.

    If you want to set the timer but don't want it to start, then your
  trigger must have both the set timer and the stop timer trigger events,
  both of which should be activated at the same time.  The stop timer
  event must be the second of the two trigger events; if it isn't, the
  timer will be stopped then have its time set (having its time set causes
  the timer to start counting down).


[7-9]  What is the Zone of a cell?
==================================
    There appear to be two different forms of "zone" as they refer to
  cells.  Both of the two types depend on which cell is being used.  There
  are only two types of cells on the map: those that are passable by a
  ground unit, and those that are not.

    If the cell being used to determe the "zone" is a passable cell,
  then the zone of this cell will be that area of the map that a
  ground-based unit can reach.  So, if this was a totally blank map, the
  "zone" of that cell would be the entire map.  If this was a map that had
  a cliff wall stretching from one side to the other, the "zone" would be
  the half of the map that the cell is in.
    Parts of the map like bridges (be they land bridges or concrete
  bridges) are included in the category of passable land, so if a map was
  separated by a river that had a bridge, the "zone" would be the entire
  map, except for those parts of the river that are not passable by ground
  units.

    The other type of "zone" is where the cell is part of a non-passable
  section of land.  If this is the case, then the "zone" of this cell will
  be the non-passable sections of the map.  This includes cliffs and
  rivers, and water.  Please note the difference between this and the
  previous form of "zone", in that this form of "zone" will reveal all
  non-passable sections of land, *even if* they are not connected to the
  initial cell.  That means that a piece of cliff face totally unconnected
  to another piece of cliff face will be exposed.  Rivers and sections of
  water are also counted as part of this "zone".

    If you used the first type of "zone" for a Reveal zone of waypoint
  trigger action, then the map cells that a ground unit can move to from
  that cell will be revealed.  This can potentially reveal a very large
  amount of the map.
    If you used the second type of "zone" for a Reveal zone of waypoint
  trigger action, then all the non-passable map cells on the mission map
  This means that all the cliff faces will be revealed, as will all
  rivers, water sections etc.

    Remember that the terrain editor has a function that will show
  whether each cell is passable or not.  You can use that function to help
  determine what makes up the "zone" for a particular cell.

    One use of the "zone" would be to determine whether the player has
  landed some units on an island or not.  This would be better than
  putting celltriggers in all of the cells of the island that have an
  Entered by event.


[7-10]  Explaining Global Variables
===================================
    Why they're called globals, I don't know; Vegas-style programming
  jargon perhaps.  I think of them as flags (logical markers) which can
  have one of two states: SET (1) or CLEAR (0).  How many there can be, I
  don't know, Westwood uses as many as thirty in some missions, which
  seems plenty enough.

    All globals are clear until set. They may be set by either a trig (eg
  28,-1,-1,#) or a teamtype command (12:#), where # = a number, the name
  of the global variable.  They may be cleared only by a trig
  (29,-1,-1,#).

    The trigger events 27 and 28 (Global is set... and Global is
  clear...) are tests to check the state of the named global. (27,-1,#):
  This trigger will fire if # is set.

    Example:
      teamtype,etc,etc,3:9,3:5,12:15,3:8
      trig1=0,1,0,1,27,-1,15,0,-1,0,7,22,-1,-1,29,-1,-1,10
    When a member of the teamtype reaches waypoint 5, global 15 becomes
  set and trig1 will fire, sending the reinforcements in and clearing
  global 10.

    Every mission begins with all globals clear.


[7-11]  When a Building Must Be Captured, Not Destroyed
=======================================================
    In the original C&C, when we wanted to specify that a building needed
  to be captured to win the mission, but the mission was lost if that
  building was destroyed, we could use the Cap=Win/Des=Lose trigger
  action.  However, in Red Alert, this trigger action does not exist, but
  we can easily create it with our own trigger.

  (thanks to Jaakko Nenonen for this trigger example)
      capture=0,2,3,0,1,-1,2,7,-1,0,1,-1,-1,2,2,-1,-1,2

    Then you just attach this to the building you want to be captured but
  not destroyed (naturally, you would use the correct country number for
  your real trigger).

    The above trigger equates to:
    "if country 2 captures (Entered by trigger) the building, then win
  action is fired for country 2"
    OR
    "if the building is destroyed by anyone, then the lose action is
  fired for country 2"


[7-12]  Using your own names
============================
    With the Counterstrike patch (v1.07), an additional useful section
  has been added to the unit and structure sections of the rules.ini file
  that allows you to change the name of that particular unit or
  structure.  It must be noted that this does not work with the original
  version of Red Alert, only the patched version.
    To change the name of a particular item, you either edit the
  rules.ini or add this information into the mission's ini file.  For
  example, if you wanted to change the name of the light tank (1TNK), you
  would have the following section:
      [1TNK]
      Name=Bradley
    By putting these changes into your mission's ini file, you can change
  the name of a unit for a single mission, and then have it revert to its
  original name.


[7-13]  Blowing up bridges
==========================
    To blow up a bridge, you need to do two things: first, you need to
  place the celltriggers on the area of the map that covers the section
  of the bridge that you want to blow up.  Secondly, you must create a
  set of triggers - one to detonate the bridge and another to force this
  trigger.  Having the bridge detonation trigger on a time trigger event
  does not seem to work - I can only get bridges to blow up when the
  trigger is forced.

    You can decide to either damage a bridge, or blow it up completely.
  This is accomplished by using a single Destroy attached... trigger, or
  using two of them.  For example, the following trigger will only
  damage a bridge:
      brid=0,7,0,0,0,-1,0,0,-1,0,32,-1,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,-1
  while the following trigger will blow up the bridge completely:
      brid=0,7,0,1,0,-1,0,0,-1,0,32,-1,-1,-1,32,-1,-1,-1


[7-14]  Advanced Editing: Just how extensible is Red Alert?
===========================================================
    When it comes to creating campaigns for Red Alert, is the rules.ini
  file really enough for what you need, or do you feel the need to add
  your own special touch to Red Alert?  In the following paragraphs, I
  will discuss various items I have been able to edit for Red Alert that
  goes well beyond what the rules.ini file allows.  Indeed, as I
  discovered these things, I was left pondering the question: just how
  extensible is Red Alert?

    The first, and most important bit of knowledge you should have is
  that Red Alert can read the C&C-style .mix files.  This is important
  because the C&C-style .mix file headers are understood, which allows the
  placement and replacement of files, while the Red Alert-style .mix file
  headers are not understood.  To do most of the following pieces of
  editing for your campaign, you will need one of the utilities that allow
  you to create your own .mix files.  There are, as far as I know, only
  two such programs, ccmix and mixmaker.  If you do a search for 'ccmix'
  on HotBot (http://www.hotbot.com), it should return a list of 6 or so
  sites, one of which contains this file.

    To have Red Alert recognise that you want it to use your new .mix
  file, you need to give the .mix file a particular name.  This name has
  the format sc*.mix (and apparently also ss*.mix), where * is replaced
  by up to 6 letters or digits.  You then place this new .mix file in
  your Red Alert directory, and Red Alert will be able to utilise any
  data you place in it.  It is common to use the filenames sc-001.mix,
  sc-002.mix etc (up to sc-999.mix).  If you use these names, you can
  be certain that the information in the higher numbered mix file will
  be used if it ia also contained within a lower number mix file (eg. a
  file called scu01ea.ini appearing in sc-812.mix will not be used if
  a similarly named file appears in sc-890.mix).

    For most Red Alert campaign creators, you will want to use the basic
  functionality that these sc*.mix files provide.  If you place your new
  .ini files into one of these .mix files, when Red Alert goes to play
  that mission, it will use the ini file from your .mix file, rather than
  that of the original mission.  If your mission contains many mission
  files, it is much cleaner to supply one .mix file for the user to use. 
  However, if you are just supplying one or two missions, I wouldn't
  bother.  You should always remember to stick to the correct naming
  conventions for the new ini files.  Unfortunately, it does not appear
  that the file tutorial.ini gets read from your .mix file, so if your
  campaign uses new text from a tutorial.ini file, you will still have to
  supply that separately.  Nor does the mission.ini file get read, so that
  must also be supplied separately.

    To those people that want to go the extra mile, these .mix files can
  contain more than just the various mission ini files of your campaign. 
  They can also contain .shp and .aud files.  This is the method that you
  can use to give the civilian buildings V20 to V37 that don't originally
  have a set of graphics some graphics of their own. 

    Normally when you want to place a .shp file to replace the graphics
  of a unit or building you give it the extension .shp.  However, civilian
  buildings are slightly different.  The graphics for civilian buildings
  are normally stored in the snow.mix or temperat.mix files, rather than
  the normal conquer.mix (inside the main.mix file).  To replace the
  graphics of a civilian building, you must give it an extension related
  to the theater it will appear in.  For the Temperate theater, this
  extension is '.tem'; for the Snow theater, this extension is '.sno' (I
  would imagine that the extension for the Interior theater is '.int', but
  haven't tested that).  For example, if I wanted to provide a graphic for
  civilian structure V23 for the Temperate theater, the file I would add
  to my .mix file would have the filename of 'V23.tem'.

    For non-civilian buildings, the files you add have the extension
  '.shp'.  Say I was going to add a graphic called ANDR that I could then
  call from the rules.ini file.  If I didn't intend this structure to be
  buildable, then I would just add the file 'andr.shp' to the .mix file. 
  However, if I wanted this to be used on a structure that gets build,
  then I should also include a file called 'andrmake.shp'.  This file
  contains the graphics that Red Alert will use during the 'building up'
  phase after the structure is placed.  If this file does not exist, when
  the structure using the ANDR graphic is placed, it will just suddenly
  appear (which does not look good).  Finally, if I wanted the user to be
  able to build this structure, I should also include the file
  'andricon.shp', which contains the graphic that Red Alert uses for the
  icon.  If this file isn't supplied, the cell in the sidebar where this
  icon would normally be displayed will be blank, and suffer from
  'bleeding' from the other graphics.  I do not know how Red Alert
  differentiates between the DOS and Windows95 icons.  The same is done
  for vehicles, ships and infantry that you want to replace (although they
  only need the base graphic and the icon graphic).  The base graphic must
  have a maximum 4 letter title (CFH will work but CFHAR will not). 
  Construction graphics (for buildings) take this base name and add MAKE
  to the end, while icon graphics take the base name and add ICON to the
  end.

    Special Note: the graphics for the hidden pillbox and the missile
  silo are also theater-specific, so they must be treated as you would
  when replacing civilian building graphics. ie to replace the graphic
  for a missile silo in the temperate theater with a graphic called BANG,
  you would need to include the file bang.tem, bangmake.tem, and
  bangicon.shp.  Yes, the icon has the .shp extension.

    One final note on replacing graphics: your new graphics should be as
  close to the original size of the building as possible, otherwise
  graphics clipping problems occur.  You will have to work out what size
  you can use for yourself.  You should also keep the number of frames
  of animation in your new graphic the same as of the original graphic.

    Thanks to Vladan Bato, we have a utility that can convert .wav files
  to C&C-style .aud files.  This means that you can create your own .aud
  files, and place them in your .mix files.  If you look in section [5-3] 
  Available Red Alert Speeches you will see the list of .aud files that
  Red Alert uses to inform you of certain occurances.  By placing your own
  .aud files with the same name as the original (eg say I wanted to
  replace the original "Mission accomplished" speech, I would put a file
  called 'misnwon1.aud' in my .mix file), you can get Red Alert to use
  your .aud files instead of the original ones. 

    In addition, it is possible to change the responses of the various
  units by placing the correctly-named .aud file into your .mix file.  For
  example, if I recorded and converted James Bond saying "Shaken, not
  stirred", I could get the spy to say that by placing the file
  'sking1.aud' (this would replace the "For king and country" response of
  the spy).  See Section [5-4]  Available Red Alert Sound Effects for the
  filenames (in the Abbrev. column) that you would need to replace.  I am
  unsure of whether all the entries in that table use the .aud format that
  Vladan's program supports, but at the very least the infantry responses
  do.  Hmm, can't wait for the Simpson's Red Alert add-on :)

    It may also be possible to replace the songs in Red Alert with your
  own music.  I have only tried this with replacing the AWAIT soundtrack
  (as it doesn't originall appear), and this worked (ie I placed the file
  await.aud in my .mix file).  I am unsure of whether the other songs can
  be replaced by placing the specified file in your .mix file (you will
  have to work this out for yourself).

    You can replace even the videos in Red Alert, although you cannot add
  new ones apparently.  I am talking about the .vqa videos, not the .wsa
  animations (I have not tested whether .wsa animations can also be
  replaced, but I would guess that they could).  To do this, you simply
  place a .vqa file in your .mix file that has the same name as the
  abbreviation of the movie (see Available Red Alert Movies for this
  listing).  I do not know whether there is a .vqa encoder available at the
  current moment, nor do I know whether Red Alert's vqa format is the same
  as that of C&C's vqa format (you can use C&C videos in Red Alert, but
  the palette is so different as to make this pointless).

    Looking back, it seems as though pretty much everything in Red Alert
  can be replaced by using a custom-made mix file.  The question is: what
  else can be changed?  Really, only the actual map graphics themselves
  are left to be seen if they can be changed.  I do not know if this can
  be done, but if it can, Red Alert can be seen in an entirely new light. 
  Perhaps unknowingly, we have been given a program that is almost
  infinitely extensible.


[7-15]  Remote detonation - the cell of death
=============================================
    If you are looking at the Counterstrike ant missions and wondering
  how Westwood created the mission where you gas the various nest sites, I
  will now explain how you can get this same functionality (ie killing
  things if they move into certain areas).  To do this, you use an
  ingenious function of a celltrigger that I had not even thought of being
  possible.

    What you want to do is create what I will call the kill trigger. 
  This is the trigger that will kill everything that walks over it.  It
  has the form:
      kill=2,0,0,0,1,-1,10,0,-1,0,32,-1,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,-1

    It needs, as its trigger event, an 'Enters by' event, although you
  would naturally change the country number.  You could then use the free
  second trigger event to hold any other event you want, such as a 'global
  is set' event.  The trigger action, as you will notice, is a destroy
  attached item.  This is what does the killing for you.

    When any unit (of the specified country) enters this cell, it will
  die!  Simple as that.  You just place these triggers around your map
  where you want your 'zones of death' to be, and you are set. 
  Apparently, Red Alert treats units that activate an 'entered by' trigger
  the same, when it comes to the destruction function, as if those units
  had a destroy trigger manually attached.

    However, you need to know that units in the cell at the time when it
  is activated will not die (at least not until they enter another cell
  of death).  Only units that actively enter the cell will be killed. 
  So, a tank sitting in the cell when it is turned on will not get killed,
  but anything else entering the cell will be.  You will need to carefully
  think about the placement of the death zones if you want to kill
  everything.


[7-16]  Getting units to destroy bridges via teamtypes
======================================================
    If you don't want to blow up bridges via triggers, you can always get
  the computer units to do this.  All you need to do is place a waypoint
  on the part of the bridge that the units are to attack, and give the
  particular teamtype an 'attack waypoint' command.  You should give the
  teamtype an additional command after this 'attack waypoint' command, so
  that the units in this team don't continue to attack a destroyed
  bridge.  This additional command can be anything, including further
  commands to destroy another bridge.  This command will not be initiated
  until the 'attack waypoint' command is completed; in this case it won't
  be completed until the bridge has been destroyed.

    So your teamtype would have something like (assuming waypoint 20 is
  on a bridge)  <blah>,1:20,0:1<blah>, which would have the teamtype
  attack the bridge until it is destroyed, and would then go and attack
  enemies somewhere else on the map.

    However, I have not managed to get the Tanya (E7) unit to attack a
  bridge with the C4.  When given the 'attack waypoint' command, the Tanya
  unit uses her pistols instead of the C4.

    One very useful attribute of getting units to attack bridges is that
  they are smart enough to not attack a bridge that has already been
  destroyed.  This is very useful if you have teamtypes attempting to
  destroy multiple bridges.  You do not need to be concerned about the
  units in the teamtype attacking a section of river that used to be a
