/**
 * Image in .CPS format
 *
 * The .CPS files contain 320x200x256 images. The images are compressed with the
 * Format80 compression method. They may or may not contain a palette.
 *
 * The header has the following structure :
 * Header : record
 *     Size    : word;  {File size - 2}
 *     Unknown : word;  {Always 0004h}
 *     ImSize  : word;  {Size of uncompressed image (always 0FA00h)}
 *     Palette : longint; {Is there a palette ?}
 * end;
 *
 * If Palette is 03000000h then there's a palette after the header, otherwise
 * the image follows.
 * CPS file without palette can be found in the SETUP.MIX file, and they all use
 * the Palette that can be found inside the same .MIX.
 *
 * The image that follows the palette (or the Header) is in Format80 which is
 * explained above.
