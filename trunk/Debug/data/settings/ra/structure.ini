;This file contains all values for the structures in FreeCNC
;Obviously lines beginning with ";" are ignored
;
;
;description of variables used:
;Items with a * by them have not yet been implemented
;
;layers  - number of layers a structure has (default 1)
;image2  - image name of second layer (def none)
;
;health  - maximum health (also default unless specified)
;power   - amount of power generated
;drain   - amount of power required
;powered - structure is disabled in the event of a (brown|black)out
;primary_weapon - same as unit.ini
;secondary_weapon - ditto
;turret  - does the structure have to turn to face direction of fire?
;rot     - same as unit.ini, used with turret
;
;Animation parameters
;
;loopend - final frame in a looped animation (def 0)
;loopend2- same but for second layer (currently only weap)
; the code assumes that the anim is the same length when building
; is damaged.
;
;speed   - the priority of the animation (lower is faster), (def 3)
;delay   - the delay on the animation (higher is more delay) (def 0)
; delay was added to slow down the NUKE and NUK2 animations
; (n.b.) delay must not be too large as building's state is wont be
; updated as often, so damage might not be instantly reflected.
; To see what I mean, set a delay to about 100 and try damaging the
; structure.
;
;animtype- the type of animation: 0 none (def), 1 loop, *2 once,
;          *3 toggle loop, 4 loop using togoff,
;          5 toggle loop using 2nd layer, *6 turret style anim
;sectype - the type of secondary animation (same as above)
; (n.b. this is internal to the game)
; secanims have a seperate param passed to them (e.g. no of bails to
; refine) by the code.
;
;dmgoff  - offset to add to image when damaged
;dmgoff2 - ditto, but for second layer
; the default for both is zero, however if it is zero the offset
; is calculated as the layer's loopend+1
; the only time (so far) when this is not the desired effect is for PROC
; because its frames are such that the refine anim comes after the normal
; animation, so we have to skip over this
;togoff - offset to add to image when toggled (and animtype is 4)
;
; A lot of the numbers in this file (anim lengths, offsets, etc.) should not
; be changed (but it should make things easier for modders if they want to
; use completely new animations)
