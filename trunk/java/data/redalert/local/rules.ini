; indicates the IQ level (or above) that the ability will be granted. Because such
; abilities are automatically performed by the computer, giving a human controlled

; ******* Warhead Characteristics *******
; This is what gives the "rock, paper, scissors" character to the game.
; It describes how the damage is to be applied to the target. The
; values should take into consideration the 'area of effect'.
; example: Although an armor piercing tank round would instantly
; kill a soldier IF it hit, the anti-infantry rating is still
; very low because the tank round has such a limited area of
; effect, lacks pinpoint accuracy, and acknowledges the fact that
; tanks pose little threat to infantry that take cover.

; Spread = damage spread factor [larger means greater spread] (def=1)
;          [A value of 1 means the damage is halved every pixel distant from center point.
;          a value of 2 means damage is halved every 2 pixels, etc.]
; Wall = Does this warhead damage concrete walls (def=no)?
; Wood = Does this warhead damage wood walls (def=no)?
; Ore = Does this warhead destroy ore (def=no)?
; Verses = damage value verses various armor types (as percentage of full damage)...
;           -vs- none, wood (buildings), light armor, heavy armor, concrete
; Explosion = which explosion set to use when warhead of this type impacts (def=0)
;             0=none, 1=piff, 2=piffs, 3=fire, 4=frags, 5=pops, 6=nuke
; InfDeath = which infantry death animation to use (def=0)

; ******* Mission Control *******
; This specifies the various general behavior characteristics of
; the missions that objects can be assigned. Each of the game objects must
; be in a mission. The mission behavior is generally hard coded into
; the program, but there are some behavior characteristics that can
; be overridden. Don't modify these.

; NoThreat = Is its weapons disabled and thus ignored as a potential target until fired upon (def=no)?
; Zombie = Is forced to sit there like a zombie and never recovers (def=no)?
; Recruitable = Can it be recruited into a team or base defense (def=yes)?
; Paralyzed = Is the object frozen in place but can still fire and function (def=no)?
; Retaliate = Is allowed to retaliate while on this mission (def=yes)?
; Scatter = Is allowed to scatter from threats (def=yes)?
; Rate = delay between normal processing (larger = faster game, less responsiveness)
; AARate = anti-aircraft delay rate (if not specifed it uses regular rate).

; Unit sits still and plays dead.
