This section will outline how to successfully compile OpenRedAlert.

5.1. Requirements
==============================
 
  Supported compilers:
  - GCC G++ version 3.3 or newer.
  - A recent verions of Dev C++ .

  Libraries:
  - SDL 1.2.8 or newer.
  - SDL_mixer 1.2.5 or newer.

5.2. Compiling with GCC
=======================

  The only thing to do is to get the latest version of source at :

  $> svn checkout http://openredalert.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ openredalert

  Before make sure that the SDL library and SDL_mixer library is installed.
  On many distribution these packages are nammed 'libsdl' and 'libsdl-mixer'

  Go to the folder created, there are a Makefile in it

  type :
  $> make

  The file compiled is in the obj folder.
  move it in the Debug/ folder

  Copy the 2 .mix files (MAIN.MIX & REDALERT.MIX) in the folder 'Debug/data/mix/'

  After you can run openredalert

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Data Files
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Only two files are needed for Red Alert:
    * redalert.mix
    * main.mix

  Both files can be found on either Red Alert CD.  Both CDs have the maps for
  both campaigns but only the videos for one.

 Copy the 'data' folder in the folder of OpenRedAlert
 Copy the 2 mix files in the folder /openredalert/data/mix

6.1. Red Alert Demo
===================

  The demo version works !!!

  The demo version can be downloaded from here:
  ftp://ftp.westwood.com/pub/redalert/previews/demo/ra95demo.zip

  Or here :
  http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=229581&package_id=290181&release_id=624020

  As always, you only need the mix files from the archieve.

6.2. Electronic Arts - Free 2008 version
=======================================

  When RedAlert 3 was launched, EA provided the original game (2 iso CD) to download for free.
  It's only available in an english version, but it contains the original archives.
